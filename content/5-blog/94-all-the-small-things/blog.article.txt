I just returned from my long-awaited vacations with some great news and updates.

## Open Device Labs Partnership 

(link: http://lab-up.org/ text: Open device labs) are a fantastic idea. They give access to a multitude of mobile devices to developers around the world and help them test their sites and make them better and more accessible. I decided to sponsor free Kirby licenses for all Open Device Lab organizers, so they can easily setup a website for their lab. If you are about to start an Open Device Lab and you'd like to get a free Kirby license, please let me know: <bastian@getkirby.com>

If you need some inspiration, the Open Device Labs in Munich and Frankfurt already have great, Kirby-powered websites:

## Manila Theme

The guys from (link: http://empy.re text: Empy.re) created the (link: http://demo.empy.re/?theme=manila text: first commercial theme for Kirby called Manila), which is available at (link: http://themeforest.net/item/manila-responsive-microblog-portfolio/5563108 text: ThemeForest) and it's really beautiful and well worth the $20 in my opinion. So check out the demo on their site and maybe this is something for you. 

## Border:none

I'm going to speak at (link: https://border-none.net/ text: border:none) – a small, one-day conference in Nürnberg, Germany on October 25. My talk is going to be about the (link: blog/lets-build-a-better-web text: indie web) and it would be great to meet you there. Tickets are just 30 €, which is a fantastic deal. So get yours and let me know so we can chat and have a beer together :)

## New Kirby-powered websites

I've just published more than 40 new Kirby-powered websites on the (link: made-with-kirby-and-love text: "Made with Kirby and love") page. I'm again impressed by the quality and detail that has gone into those sites and I'm really happy that they all run on Kirby. Keep them coming!

## The state of Kirby 2

To be honest, Kirby 2 is becoming a painful lesson for me. It showed me that reworking too much from scratch and announcing a new release too early doesn't go well together. You guys keep asking me for news and I completely understand that and at the same time I still don't have a launch date. It's mostly because I spent extremely long on a decission for the panel, which is now made and on polishing the code for the new Kirby toolkit. I hope I will be able to launch Kirby 2 this winter. I really hope for your patience in the meantime. If you want to start making "Duke Nukem Forever" jokes, please be my guest :)
