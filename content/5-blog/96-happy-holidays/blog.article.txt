The second crazy year with Kirby is almost over and I wish you all a wonderful Christmas time with your families and fantastic start for 2014. 

Thank you so much for your support over the last months and your patience while waiting for Kirby 2. Next year I'm going to proof that this is not (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware text: vapoware) :) 

To give you a little treat for the wait, **(link: buy text: each Kirby license will be 20% off starting today until December 24th)**. Free upgrades for Kirby 2 included! So get yourself a nice little Holiday discount and see you in 2014!

Cheers, Bastian
