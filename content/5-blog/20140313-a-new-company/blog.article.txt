Some of you might remember that Kirby was being published by the OpenWe GmbH for the last years. The OpenWe GmbH was a company a friend of mine and I founded in 2007 in order to run (link: http://zootool.com text: Zootool) and later Kirby of course. 

Zootool was a visual bookmark tool which I started in university and became a very exciting adventure with more than 150,000 users during the last six years. Unfortunately we had to announce recently that Zootool is shutting down this Saturday and with Zootool the company behind it will go away as well. 

It's very sad to close that chapter in my life and it hasn't been an easy decision. But when one door closes others open. I founded my own company at the beginning of this year and I'm very excited that Kirby will now be published by my very own company, which just feels great. I'm not very creative with names, so the name of that company simply is *Bastian Allgeier GmbH*

Nothing will change for you, except a new footer, imprint and a different name on the license agreement. In fact for Kirby this means more focus. I will have more time, once Zootool is completely gone and it will be easier to hire people to help me with Kirby in the future. 

Even if it's just a small announcement I'm very happy to share this with you and I'm super excited for the coming months. 

Cheers, Bastian
