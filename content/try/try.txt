I want you to be happy with Kirby first, before you buy a license. This is why (link: http://github.com/getkirby text: Kirby's source code) is fully available without limitations. I like to call it commercial open-source.

You'll find every relevant repository around Kirby in its (link: http://github.com/getkirby text: organization on Github). Besides the (link: http://github.com/getkirby/kirby text: core), the (link: http://github.com/getkirby/panel text: Panel) and the (link: http://github.com/getkirby/starterkit text: Starterkit) there's much more great Kirby-related stuff to discover.

Try it **locally** or install it on a **non-public staging server** and give it a spin as long as you want.
