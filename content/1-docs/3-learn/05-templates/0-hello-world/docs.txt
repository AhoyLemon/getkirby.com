Title: Your first template

----

Text:

A template contains all the content for the current page.
This would be a completely valid template:

```markup
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  Hello world!
</body>
</html>
```

But of course it wouldn't be very smart. Nothing in this template is dynamic. It would just render a very basic HTML document with a title and some text.

Let's start by adding some dynamic content.

```php
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title><?php echo html($site->title()) ?></title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></h1>
  <?php echo html($page->text()) ?>
</body>
</html>
```

### $site->title()
