The radiobuttons field displays any number of radio buttons in a list. This is perfect if you have a predefined number of options, from which the user can just choose one.

## Example

  category:
    label: Category
    type: radio
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
