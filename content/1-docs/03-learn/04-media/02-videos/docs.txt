## Youtube & Vimeo Videos

Kirbytext has a built-in way to add Youtube and Vimeo videos to any page without the hassle of fiddling with those scary embed codes. All you need is the URL of the video.

```text
(\youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLuc6rtWkrM)
```
or

```text
(\vimeo: http://vimeo.com/3432886)
```

Set the width and height of the embedded video

```text
(\vimeo: http://vimeo.com/3432886 width: 400 height: 300)

```

### Responsive or what?!

Kirby will automatically wrap a `<figure>` element with a `video` class around those iframes.

```html
<figure class="video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT3mCybbhf0" width="480" height="358" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure>
```

This wrapper can be very handy when it comes to responsive design. To apply an often used 16:9 ratio to your videos just add these few lines of CSS and you're good to go.

```css
.video {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
  height: auto;
}
.video > iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

The video will scale perfectly and in the correct ratio, no matter what the current screen size is.
