Text:

All available options can be set in your config file in `/site/config` like this:

```php
c::set('option', 'value');
```

There are a number of available options in Kirby, which help you to customize the system just the way you want it.

Option | Default | Description
-        | -       | -

license | null | Setup for the license key
url | false | Overwrites Kirby's auto-detected base URL
routes | null | Additional route setup for Kirby's internal router
languages | null | Language definition for multi-language sites
timezone | UTC | The PHP timezone setting for all date functions
tinyurl.enabled | true | Enables/disables tinyurls
tinyurl.folder | x | Tinyurl format: yourdomain/{folder}/{hash}
rewrite | true | Enables/disables URL rewriting
markdown.extra | false | Enables/disables the Markdown extra parser with additional Markdown features like footnotes and tables.
markdown.breaks | true | Enables/disables automatic line breaks in Markdown like on Github. Otherwise line breaks must be confirmed with three spaces at the end of the line.
cache | false | Enables/disables Kirby's cache
cache.driver | file | Kirby has three built-in cache drivers: file, memcached and apc
cache.ignore | null | An array of URIs of pages, which should be ignored by the cache
cache.options | null | An array of options for the cache driver
headers | null | An array with template names as keys and HTTP headers as values. Those headers will be sent before the template is rendered.


## Your own options

If you need a simple way to store options throughout the system and access them in any plugin, template or snippet, you can define your own options in the same way:

```php
c::set('yourOption', 'yourValue');
```

You can fetch your options later withâ€¦

```php
echo c::get('yourOption')
// will output 'yourValue'
```

If you want to make sure to get a proper default value if the option is not set you can define a fallback:

```php
echo c::get('undefinedOption', 'fallbackValue')
// will output 'fallbackValue' if undefinedOption is undefined
```

## Multi-environment setup

Kirby has a built-in way to set different options based on the domain by adding additional config files containing the domain.

### Example setup

```
/site/config/config.localhost.php
/site/config/config.staging.yourdomain.com.php
/site/config/config.yourdomain.com.php
```

By setting different options in those config files you get a very flexible system, which can be deployed to different servers and react to the current environment accordingly.
