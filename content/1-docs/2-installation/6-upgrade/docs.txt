## Advice

Don't update directly on your live server. You need to exchange a couple of things and your website would probably be broken during the upgrade. It's better to do the upgrade on a local installation.

## Updating the /kirby and /panel folders

Updating the /kirby and /panel folder still works like with 1.x versions. Just (link: http://download.getkirby.com text: download the latest Kirby starterkit) and replace the old folders.

## New index.php

Kirby 2 will not work with the old `index.php`.
**(link: https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/blob/master/index.php text: Please upgrade to the new index.php)**

## Changed site folder structure

The folder structure in your site folder has slightly changed. Please move your folders according to the following table.

Old                    | New
-                      | -
/site/panel/accounts   | /site/accounts
/site/panel/fields     | /site/fields

## Panel config

The panel config file is no longer loaded from `/site/panel/config.php`. Instead you should move all panel configuration options to `/site/config/config.php`

## Panel fields

Panel fields are completely different and more powerful in Kirby 2. Your old custom fields will not be working in Kirby 2. Read the guide (link: docs/panel/custom-form-fields text: how to create panel fields in Kirby 2).

## Kirbytext extensions

Kirby 2 has a new concept for simpler Kirbytext extensions, which are easier to share between projects or other Kirby users. Unfortunately Kirby 1 Kirbytext extensions are not compatible with Kirby 2. Read (link: docs/advanced/kirbytext text: how to create Kirbytext extensions in Kirby 2).

## Accounts

Kirby 2 has a completely rewritten user management which supports secure password encryption. Old account files are thus no longer compatible with your new installation.

## Plugins & Themes

We've upgraded all (link: downloads text: official plugins) to work with Kirby 2. Please install the latest versions to make sure they are compatible.

3rd-party plugins and themes should mostly be compatible, but may have issues. Please let plugin and themes developers know when something is not working with Kirby 2.
