Text: 

The checkbox field generates a single checkbox, which can be used for simple on/off fields. It's perfect when you need a toggle for a certain part of your template for example. Alternatively you can also use the Toggle field instead.

## Example

```
fields: 
  header: 
    label: Header
    type: checkbox
    text: Do you want to display the header image?    
```
