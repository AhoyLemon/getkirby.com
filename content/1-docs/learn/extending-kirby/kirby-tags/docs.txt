Title: 

Kirby Tags

----

Text: 

Kirby's extension for Markdown — Kirbytext — provides users with a set of easy to understand tags, which help to format text, create links or embed media without knowing how to write HTML. Those tags can be extended with a simple API. 

## /site/tags

Custom tags are located in `/site/tags`. Create the folder if it doesn't exist yet. Each tag goes into its own php file. The php file must be named according to the tag name.

## Creating your first tag

In this section we are going to create a very simple tag, which will help users to link to Wikipedia articles. The syntax for this tag will be

````
(wikipedia: cms)
````

This will be replaced in the HTML code with the full link to 

```
http://en.wikipedia.org/cms
```

The code for this custom tag is very simple:

```php
<?php

kirbytext::$tags['wikipedia'] = array(
  'html' => function($tag) {
    return 'http://en.wikipedia.org/' . $tag->attr('wikipedia');
  }
);
```
