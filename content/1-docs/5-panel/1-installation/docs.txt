Text: 

The panel is included in Kirby's starterkit and boilerplate. The application is located on your server in the **/panel** folder. Please read the installation guide if the panel folder does not exist yet.

## Running the installer

Visit `http://yourdomain.com/panel` to start Kirby's installer. It will check for any issues with your installation. 

### Possible issues

1. Make sure that the content folder and all subfolders and files are writable 
2. Make sure the /thumbs folder exists and is writable
3. Make sure the /site/accounts folder exists and is writable

Once all those checks have passed, the installer will jump to the user signup form.
