Title: Deletable

----

Text: 

By default pages can be deleted in the panel. In some cases you may want to protect important pages from deletion.

This setting will prevent panel users from deleting pages that use this blueprint:

```
…
deletable: false
…
```

Even when deleting is enabled, remember a page that has subpages cannot be deleted. You have to delete its subpages first.
