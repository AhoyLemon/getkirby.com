Title: Custom Panel CSS

----

Description: Learn how to change the default styles of the Panel with your own CSS file.

----

Text:

The design of the panel is as reduced as possible to focus on the content of you and your clients. If you want to spice it up a little or adjust it to your own branding, you can do that by adding your own CSS rules in a custom stylesheet file. 

Any external stylesheet can be linked in your config file

```php
// absolute links
c::set('panel.stylesheet', 'http://example.com/assets/css/panel.css');

// relative links
c::set('panel.stylesheet', '/assets/css/panel.css');
```

For security reasons it is not possible to include a custom javascript file.
