## File fields

You can store any additional meta data for a file. This can be very handy to add captions to images or provide more information about downloads, etc.

The form, in which this data can be entered can be found in the sidebar of the fileviewer. Additional fields can be setup just like page fields. All field types, which are available for pages are also available for files.

**Please check out the cheat sheet for a (link: docs/cheatsheet/#panel-fields text: full list of available panel field types).**

The configuration for those fields go right into the file settings:

```
…
files:
  fields:
    caption:
      label: Caption
      type: textarea
…
```

## Sortable files

Files are sorted by their filenames by default. Since Kirby 2 it's also possible to sort files by drag & drop in the files manager. You have to switch this feature on in the blueprint's file settings. Sorting files by drag & drop will add a `sort` field to the file's meta data. Here's how to activate manual sorting.

```
…
files:
    sortable: true
…
```
To make use of manual sorting in your templates you must sort files by the newly generated sort field:

```
<?php foreach($page->files()->sortBy('sort', 'asc') as $file): ?>
…
<?php endforeach ?>
```

## Hide files

Like pages, files can be entirely hidden in the panel as well. They won't appear in the sidebar and the files manager will not be accessible either. This can be helpful if panel users shouldn't be able to view or edit files for certain pages.

```
files:
  hide: true
```
