A blueprint can have any number of fields, which will build the main form for the page. This is how a typical list of fields look like:

```
…
fields: 
  title: 
    label: Title
    type: text
  date: 
    label: Date
    type: date
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
…
```

Please check out the docs about available field types for more information how to set those fields up.
