Title: Custom language variables

----

Text:

When working with multi-language site projects, you often run into the problem of needing language-specific variables/strings. Simple things like translated button labels for your contact form for example or other translatable parts, which don't need to be administrated by editors.

For such a case, Kirby has a built-in language variable management.

Add the folder `/site/languages` and insert a PHP file with the specific language shortcode for each available language:

```
/site/languages/en.php
/site/languages/de.php
/site/languages/fr.php
```

Those files can contain as many custom variables as you need.

#### /sites/languages/en.php

```php
<?php

l::set('submit', 'Submit');
l::set('cancel', 'Cancel');

?>
```

#### /sites/languages/de.php

```php
<?php

l::set('submit', 'Abschicken');
l::set('cancel', 'Abbrechen');

?>
```

Those translated variables can be used in any template, plugin or snippet:

```php
<input type="submit" value="<?php echo l::get('submit') ?>" />
```
