Title: What are the system requirements for Kirby

----

Text:

Kirby runs on PHP 5.3+, Apache 2 or Ngnix. Lighthttpd should be doable but is not officially supported.

Kirby has been successfully tested on MAMP, XAMPP and PHP's built-in server for local installations.

Kirby is not compatible with IIS.
