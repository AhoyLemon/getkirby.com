Title: What's the difference between a personal and a professional license?
----
Text:

The personal license may only be used for personal and non-commercial projects. For example your blog, as long as it is not generating any income via advertisement.

The personal license does not include any support via email and there are no available volume discounts.

The professional license is valid for any non-personal or commercial project. With a professional license you can contact us via email if you run into any issues during the installation for example. We also offer great volume discounts for the professional license.
