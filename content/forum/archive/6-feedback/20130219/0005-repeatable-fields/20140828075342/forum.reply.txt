Yes, I know, for myself that's ok but for clients probably error prone ... so it would be good if they would just have to enter content into fields instead of getting the structure/indents right, don't you think?

BTW: Has anyone figured out how to define structured fields in the panel blueprints for the Kirby 2 panel? It's not in the docs yet ...
