Text: @greetintheworld I'm super sorry to hear this. I'm pretty sure your request got lost somewhere. I'm not very often on the forum, because there's simply too much time spent on answering incoming support requests via email, but please feel free to contact me anytime over email again: <bastian@getkirby.com>
