Text: It is my first day with K2 and it all looks really nice and promising, however my migration from k1 to k2 is not being so smooth and I am missing the in page error reporting so I can track down my bugs.
K2 seems to have replaced error reporting with its own friendlier message, but it hides all the good information.
Where I would usually read about a fatal error on line X now I just get the "Site currently not available" page.
I understand how this is often better for site visitors, but we should be able to easily switch this option via config for example.  
Unless there is a way and I am missing it, this was a lot more straight forward in k1.

Cheers
