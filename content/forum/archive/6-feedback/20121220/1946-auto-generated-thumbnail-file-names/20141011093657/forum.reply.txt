Text: @bastianallgeier , Well, I'm still waiting this solution to implement.  Current thumbnail system still need some attention.  sometime they still generate duplicate image. Not to mention that once we deleted the original image, the thumb still exist on thumb folder. 

What about put user in control to define thumbnail setting at dashboard panel first along with all thumbnail setting. Perhaps something like this. 
its straightforward and easy to use.

and then each content have specific thumb folder with thumb key parameter as filename.
something like:
image-name.jpg

will generate:
/thumbs/image-name-small.jpg
/thumbs/image-name-medium.jpg
/thumbs/image-name-large.jpg

and once we delete one single thumbnail key: example "large" , all thumbnail with -large filename are deleted too.  With this, we have optimal thumbnail system.

thanks
