Text: It appears the forum beta has been released. I have a strong feeling that could be tweaked into a comment system quite easily if any of you are wanting something now.

However, I still plan to build a custom solution for my own needs which will allow more than just Twitter users but also Facebook, Instagram, etc. Bastian could integrate that by using Opauth which I have mentioned previously to him a while back. One thing that's interesting is the file system, free of not using a DB.

Nice work, Bastian.
