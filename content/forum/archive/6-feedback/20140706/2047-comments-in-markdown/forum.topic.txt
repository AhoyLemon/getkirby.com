Text: Hi all, 

I want to include comments into my markdown / text files to be more verbose about how different fields may be used. Unfortunately,
kirby seems to treat them as normal text. 

I tried:
`<!---
your comment goes here
and here -->`

`[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)`

and 

`[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)`

Is there a way to put comments into the .md or .txt files in a way that they would not be parsed by kirby but shown in the panel?

Btw. The forum seems to filter out comments, so it might be the version I use? (I'm on 1.1.1) 

Thank you in advance for your answers!

cheers, 
Johannes
