Text: Hello, I'm pretty excited with Kirby 2.0. It's so spot on! Definitely I will use kirby for next client project. 

Anyway after testing and trying getting handy with kirby, I have issue with the way kirby panel handle the image. 

Here is the case:
Most today website, hero image seems a must. With current panel, there is problem when client want to put some image with random name. If I'm not wrong, the solution is by hardcoded filename into some code like this. $page->images()->find('01.jpg');

Well it's seems this solution is not quite user friendly since client must follow several rule. Example Hero image 1 filename must: xxxxxxx.jpg

What if client want to use different file names so their image will be semantic and better for SEO purpose? here is standalone file field kick-in.

Here is suggested blueprint panel. 
some_file:
label: Some File
type: file

and then.... boom!! file field appear on panel. Next part, After uploading somefiles.jpg into panel, client just drag and drop files into file field. 

Voila!!! Client finally able upload file with random name...

It's just like the way textarea field handling image but returned value is some url without p tag. 

Since Kirby already have awesome file handling panel, I believe this solution seems quite easy to implement.

Looking forward... :D
