Text: Can not figure out where the problem, got:
Fatal error: Class 'g' not found in \site\snippets\map.php on line 2

Added map.php from here: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/snippets/map/map.php
to my snippets folder...and included snippet in template...

Would be very happy to get any clues... otherwise I'm stuck...
(testing site locally with xampp)
