Text: I think making a Twitter account a requirement for registering on this forum prevents some people from participating. I had to create a Twitter account especially for this forum because I never used (nor do I have any other reason to use) Twitter before. And it's pretty hard to come up with a valid Twitter handle to be honest, because it feels like all usernames are already taken. This made registering on the Kirby forum a hassle. Also, I do not know anybody who uses Twitter in my personal life, not even programmers I know use it, and I don't think all Kirby users are Twitter users, maybe not even most of them. Maybe dropping Twitter as a requirement will allow the forum to grow faster in the future?
