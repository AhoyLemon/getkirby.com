Text: This might be quite useful,  I'm working on a centos machine and I'm not totally used to it.  I have to run the following quite regularly:

    chown -R apache:apache ./
    find ./ -type f -exec chmod 664 {} ;
    find ./ -type d -exec chmod 775 {} ;
    chown my.user:my.group ./

to strip permissions locks.  Git introduces these permissions issues too.  I think a smarter working practice might be the key in my case at least.
