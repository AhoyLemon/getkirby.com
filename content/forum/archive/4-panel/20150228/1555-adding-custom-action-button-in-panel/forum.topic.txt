Text: Looking for solution - in Panel (in blueprint page) need button similar as built-in SAVE button, but with different action - maybe someone can advice where to start. Or have some example.
Will try to make my own by adding button under "fields" folder. But not sure if button qualifies as "field".

If I am more specific - button will generate site content as JSON and will save JSON file to local folder.

Any lead or idea will be much appreciated ;)
