Text: Hey,

I wanted to change the folder structure for multi-environments and followed this article: http://getkirby.com/blog/multi-environment-setup

Everything works fine except the panel.

When opening http://localhost/mysite/panel I got a blank screen. 
Since I followed the documentation I am wondering why it is not working...

Anyone any idea?
