Text: Hi all,

I hope I can make this as clear as possible...

In the panel I want to make other pages in a different directory selectable for the author. I use the query option:
```
fields:
  category:
    label: architect
    type: radio
    options: query
    query: 
      page: architects
      fetch: children
```
So far so good... the pages in the directory "architects" are displayed and can be selected in the panel.

But when I want to display the selected architect on the page, only the uid(or something else) is displayed ("firstname-lastname"). 
What type of object do I get when I write: 
```
<php echo $page->architect() ?>
```
Is it just a string?

I assumed I can access the page object of the selected architect to display the title (Firstname Lastname). 
I found (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/field-methods/pages text: this) and tried:
```
<php echo $page->architect()->pages()->title()->html() ?>
```

But it still doesn't work.
Anybody any idea?

Cheers 
Andreas
