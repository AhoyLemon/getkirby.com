Text: Dear all, 
I ask for your help because I can't figure out why I can't save changes in the panel. The panel doesn't show me any 'fix permission' warning. At first I set the permission as Bastian suggested (here)[http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/troubleshooting/permissions] but with no luck. I even tried permission 777. I double checked my `.htaccess` and my `config.php` and everything should be in place. Every time I hit the save button the page deletes my changes and keeps what was set in the first place in the `.txt` file.

Thanks for any suggestion
