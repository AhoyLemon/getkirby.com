Text: I noticed some problems with deleting of  the standard files after adding multiple languages with locale '/de', '/en' and so on.

The files previously stored in the directoy without any locale variable were still there and used from the system. After deleting the ununsed files and only keeping the files with locale variables, it worked just fine .
