Text: I'm working on the blueprints for my site. Is there a way to force the existing subpages I've made to take on the new blueprint I've created for their main page? 

```
title: Design Page
pages:
  template: design

...etc
```

I want the subpages already created to reflect the blueprint. I hope that makes sense. 

Thank you!
