Text: +1 for this. 

I find it confusing for clients to tell them after they have added a subpage they first need to make it visible.
It would be a lot easier if we can set a default param in a blueprint,  for example:

```
pages: 
  template: testimonials
  limit: 10
  visible: true

```
