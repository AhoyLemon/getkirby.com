I read the article but still I don't understand why this happens. For example :P  Using Kirby2 (and I LOVE IT!)

Logging into the panel --> adding a new page for example the main page for the webshop section. 
I created a blueprint for this  site/blueprint & also a template /site/templates. 

So when I add a new page I want to be able to chose the webshop template. But the selection box is locked.
