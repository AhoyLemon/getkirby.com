Text: I also found this default behaviour confusing.   
I still don't really understand how it is supposed to work.
Can someone provide an example setup with say 3 different templates
that are available at the root level of the Panel in stead of only the default one?

Expected result:  
- go to Panel
- add new page
- be able to select one of multiple templates in dropdown

Current result:
- go to Panel
- add new page
- overlay window presents a locked dropdown with only one option, the Default blueprint

Thanks
