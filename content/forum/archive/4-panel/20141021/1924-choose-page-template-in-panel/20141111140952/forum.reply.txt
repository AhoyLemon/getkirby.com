Text: Hey guys, 

I'm sorry for the confusion. It should probably be a bit more clear in the starterkit. Normally this is very easy. You got multiple ways to handle which blueprints may be selected for subpages. You can find more about it here: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints/page-settings#templates-for-subpages

I hope this helps.
