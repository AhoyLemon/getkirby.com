Text: If you want to use a comma separated list, you can use the field type "tags" (http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/panel-fields/tags), which makes it easier to call in the template because of the inbuilt explode-function. For the structured field, you would have to change the field type in the blueprint to sth. like:

```
author:
    label: Author Avatars
    type: structure
    required: true
    fields:
        label: Avatar
        type: user
```
