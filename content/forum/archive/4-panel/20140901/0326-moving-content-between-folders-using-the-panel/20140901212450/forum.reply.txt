Text: Indeed this would be a nice addition, and I believe down the road it is something Bastian intends to work on incorporating. I've read previous statements on the subject from him though, and he said something along the lines of "It can get a little messy" when moving files around, opposed to just creating/deleting/editing them.

You may consider using tags, or a select field instead, and storing them all in the same directory but filtering which results show on each page using a tag.

For active trips page you'd have a flow like:

foreach $trips as $trip
if $trip->status() == 'active' echo $trip->text()
