Text: Hi, I'm working on a site for a travelagent.

He offers trips and I constructed a foldersetup, with:

- Trips he is prepairing
- Trips he is doing soon (All the trip details are fix)
- Trips he has done allready (An archive some how)  

Manageing it via FTP works great, but it would be nice, if there's a solution for moving a "Trip" from one to another of these folders.

**Thanks for your help!**

*Btw: The how to archive blog posts approach that I found wasn't helpfull since it left the posts where they are and messed up the contentfolder somehow.*
