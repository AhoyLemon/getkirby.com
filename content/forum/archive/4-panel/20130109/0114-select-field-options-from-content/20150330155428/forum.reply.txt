Text: Just getting into Kirby and came across this article. I'm looking to relate content to existing pages also, and take it a step beyond the default 'page' form field.

Anybody have that 'pageselect' code that @rappold mentioned? The link is dead now, most likely because it's 2 years old. Would still be useful to me as I can't find this feature anywhere else.

Thanks!
