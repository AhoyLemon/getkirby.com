Text: I have a home page with sub pages. When I add a new sub page no numerical value is being added to the file name. If I have

    pages: true
        sort: flip
        num: date

In my blueprint> home .php I go into the page and input the date, save it, go to the file it has created and add any number to the beginning of the folder name. Then go back to the page and press save again it then gives it the date in the file name.

I've also just left the blueprint> home .php which should give every new page a numerical value by default but it's not doing so.

Any ideas?
