Text: Kirby 2 Panel:
From the dashboard (first level), when I click the option "add" in Pages, the template selection is grayed out.
When I click to add a subpage, the template selector is available.

I'm logged in as admin.

what do I have to do to select a template on the first level?

I'm stumped..
Please help, thanks!
