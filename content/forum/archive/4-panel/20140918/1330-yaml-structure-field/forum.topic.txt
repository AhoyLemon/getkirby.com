Text: Hi all,

Got some problem with the structure field.

It´s all working fine, accept the image tags inside structure field / textarea on home.php.The $url isn´t working for me, I have tried everything. I am doing a ”one pager” site.

I don´t know if I am doing the foreach loops wrong.

foreach($site->children()->visible() as $con):
    if($con->hasVisibleChildren()):
      foreach($con->children()->visible() as $col):
         $cfs = yaml($col->fsec());
            foreach($cfs as $cf):
                echo kirbytext($cf['ftext'])


For an example on home.php template: http://localhost/Kirby/image.jpg
when it should be: http://localhost/Kirby/content/1-project/1-test/image.jpg

Best regards / 

Fred
