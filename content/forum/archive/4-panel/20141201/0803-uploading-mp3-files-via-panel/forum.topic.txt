Text: When attempting to upload an mp3 file via the Panel I get this message:

"The upload failed"

I found this discussion:
http://getkirby.com/forum/panel/20130731/uploading-mp3-files

But I'm not able to find the proper config file (I assume this moved in version 2?)
Editing my htaccess file doesn't seem to change anything either.

Anyone have luck working with mp3 files?

Thanks!
