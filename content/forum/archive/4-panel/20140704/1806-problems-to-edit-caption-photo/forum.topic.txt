Text: Hello,
I have installed the same kirby website in two servers for test, in 1 server the panel works great, but in the second server I have a problem trying to edit the captions of photos, a 403 error is shown, the panel can not access to resource, in this case the text file.
Some idea where is the problem?

Thanks in advance.
