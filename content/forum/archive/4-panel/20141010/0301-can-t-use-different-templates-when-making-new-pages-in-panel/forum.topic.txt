Text: I created a blueprint and template which I wanted to use for a new page.

When I click "add page" I am unable to change templates, only offering the default "page" option and it has a small lock icon indicating that the page type cannot be changed.

However, if I try to add a subpage, all template options are available, including the new ones I created.

Does anyone have suggestions on how I might fix this issue, so that I can use different templates on new pages that are not subpages?
