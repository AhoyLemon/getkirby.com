Text: I had the same problem, and the following solved the issue for me (somewhat contradictory to @m_huebner's findings, though):

There is a image size restriction at 2000px for either dimension in the Kirby source code. Since I know my server can handle slightly larger images and optimized my JPG uploads towards that, the fix was to change the following lines (referring to Kirby 2.0.4):

in /panel/app/views/files/show.php – line 23 –, and
in /panel/app/views/files/index.php – line 32:

      $f->width() < 2500 and $f->height() < 2500

Also, on the same lines, the permitted filetypes are listed in lowercase – maybe you need to add "JPG" to the array that's corresponds to what you uploaded.
