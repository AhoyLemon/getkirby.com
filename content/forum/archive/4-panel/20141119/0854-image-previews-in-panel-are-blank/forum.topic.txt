Text: When I'm in Panel, edit a specific project, click on its "Files", I should see thumbnails of the images for that project. Instead I see placeholder icons that show the image filename and size.

See: http://imgur.com/a/oAmJG

Any clues how to get the image preview to work? Can I rebuild the thumbnails somehow?

Thanks
