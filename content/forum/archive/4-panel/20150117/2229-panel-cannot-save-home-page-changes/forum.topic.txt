Text: Hi,

I'm having an issue with the panel where it will open and save changes to all pages BUT the home page. When I try to save the home page it routes to the site's 404 page, but if I reload the URL it shows the home page in the panel.

I've checked content folder and file permissions, my .htaccess and config files and everything seems fine, yet it still fails to save only the home page. The site is running Kirby 1 and the panel that accompanies Kirby 1. Any help would be appreciated.
