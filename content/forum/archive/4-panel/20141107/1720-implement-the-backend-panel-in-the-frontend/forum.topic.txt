Text: Hello,

I'm working on a website where the content should be editable right in the frontend. Let's say the website is a list of posts pulling the content from Kirby's page/folder structure. Via a log-in on top, the user could add/edit a post (+ content) right in the frontend.

I didn't work with Kirby's panel so far, but thought I could create the frontend listing all the posts and giving a log-in to Kirby's panel on the same page. Logging in, you would arrive at the panel/backend which lists all posts and is styled just as the frontend, just having it editable (add, edit, remove post/page). Is this realisable or far of the track how the panel works?

Thanks!
