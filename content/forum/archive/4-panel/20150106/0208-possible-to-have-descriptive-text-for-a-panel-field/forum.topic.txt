Text: Is there a way to define a description, or instructions for a panel field?

For example, I have a field name 'Vimeo' but I would like the second part of the field label to appear in small, lighter text under the field name

I imagine something like this (quick photoshop):

Would be defined like this in the panel definition:
    vimeo:
        label: Vimeo
        description: Insert address of video 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/000000000'
        type: url
