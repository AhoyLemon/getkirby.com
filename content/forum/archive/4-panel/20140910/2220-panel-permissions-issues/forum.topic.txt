Text: I keep seeing the following error whenever I log in to the panel for a Kirby site I manage: 

The permissions in your content directory are not set properly. Please change the permissions for all folders to 0755 and for all files to 0666

I've gone through and verified all of the permissions are set correctly, however and I can edit all of the pages / site content from the panel without any issues. Is there any way to correct this?
