Text: I'm testing the new Kirby version on an old project. Every time I create a new page inside a news folder it comes up with no number thus making it invisible.

I've tried different numbering options but none seems to be working, not even default numbering. Is the panel still in beta?

#Edit:
**Sorry for asking questions about v2 while in beta in here...**

So, here's the deal:

I could hardly understand that the Pages title above the subpages was the sort option, by the way.
