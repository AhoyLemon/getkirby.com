Text: Hi, 

Is there a way to drag images/files into textareas of structure fields, or add images/files through textarea buttons inside structure fields !?

At the moment it seems impossible, textarea buttons wont work because the use of only one modal window, and I tried rearrange the modal window to not be a ”popup window”, and adding ui-droppable class to textarea and tried to drag files
to the textarea but with no luck.

Best regards /
