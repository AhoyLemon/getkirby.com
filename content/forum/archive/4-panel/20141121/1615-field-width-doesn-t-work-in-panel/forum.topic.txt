Text: The width option to display fields in a grid (as described (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints/form-fields#creating-grids text: here)) is not working for me.

```
<?php if(!defined('KIRBY')) exit ?>

title: Projects
pages:
  template: project
files: false
fields:
  title: 
    label: Title
    type: text
    width: 1/2
  subtitle: 
    label: Subtitle
    type: text
    width: 1/2
```

Any idea what I could be doing wrong?
