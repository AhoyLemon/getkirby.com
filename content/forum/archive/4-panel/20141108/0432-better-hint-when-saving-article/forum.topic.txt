Text: I know it's still quite obvious if you save an article in the panel that the button turns to green and says "Saved", but is there a way to make it even ore obvious? It would find it better if the screen jumps smoothly all the way up to the form and displays a message like "Your article has been saved". 

Would also be better from a usability viewpoint.
