Text: I logged into the new panel after making a new account (under the new kirby, older account doesn't work the same way).
Once I logged in, the screen went blank.

Source code doesn't even get as far as closing the <head> so thats strange. It gets as far as linking to the css (), base href=, and starting < style > without anything after it.

My gues is that I missed something somewhere transitioning from Kirby 1 to 2. Double checked all my steps from docs, though.
