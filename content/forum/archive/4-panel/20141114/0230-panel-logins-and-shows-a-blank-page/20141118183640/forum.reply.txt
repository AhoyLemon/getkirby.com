Text: Folks, @loasca, @simsjames:
 I did a line by line folder structure comparison between my local update blog and a fresh download of two, and it seems that having the "fields" folder in site is the problem. Even though we're moving /site/panel/fields  to /site/fields because panel doesn't exist in the new site folder folder of a clean install.  I searched the whole fresh install folder for fields and the only one is under panel/apps with completely different contents.

Once I deleted this folder, everything is working perfectly.
