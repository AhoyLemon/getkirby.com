Text: Is there a way to hide certain variables from being displayed in the panel, but still appear in the markdown file?

If omitted entirely from the blueprint, it of course will not be shown in the panel, but upon save will be deleted from the markdown file. I have a few variables that my code depends on, but ultimately my client/end user of the panel should not edit them. I've resorted to just presenting a warning messages as field info.
