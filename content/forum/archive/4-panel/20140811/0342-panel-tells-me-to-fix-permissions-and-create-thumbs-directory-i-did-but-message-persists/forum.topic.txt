Text: When I log into the Panel I get the following message:

Please fix first!
Permissions
The permissions in your content directory are not set properly. Please change the permissions for all folders to 0755 and for all files to 0666
Blueprints
(I am currently fiddling around with the PayPal shopping cart and I think this message regarding Blueprints is irrelevant.)
There are no blueprints available for the following templates

cart.php

Thumbnails
Please add a thumbs directory to the main directory of your installation and change its permissions to 0755

I have fixed the permissions and added the "thumbs" directory but I still get the same messages.

My permissions are rwxr-xr-x for folders and rw-rw-rw for files. I believe this the equivalent of 755 and 666.

BTW I can edit content but I cannot upload files.

Any help would be appreciated.
