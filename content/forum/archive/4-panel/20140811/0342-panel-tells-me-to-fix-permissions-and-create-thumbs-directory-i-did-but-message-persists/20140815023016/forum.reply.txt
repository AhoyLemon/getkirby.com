Text: Hey bydsply:

Thanks for the reply. I am changing ownership via ssh so I don't have to use terminal but as I said above, the permissions are correct as far as I can tell. Kirby panel is just reporting them as not correct.

Or am I completely missing something here.

What did you mean by the ??? ? :)
