Text: I am writing an app for teachers to use with their pupils, using kirby as the backend. Love the new panel, especially its user management. However, email is a required field when registering a new user. I know I can edit `/panel/app/forms/user.add.php` and `/panel/app/forms/user.edit.php` to set `required: false`, but would it possible to do this via a config setting instead? It would make updating simpler.
