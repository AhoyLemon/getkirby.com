Text: Hi all,

I'm trying to prevent a specific user role from accessing the panel, as they must not be able to see other users, files, etc.

I've written a custom login function, which allows them to access their files (associated with a sub-page). But I'm unable to restrict them from accessing the panel.

I've configured the role to disable the panel login, which works. But they are still able to access the panel (once they're logged in via my custom login page) if they were to type in the panel URL.

I've tried adding a route in the config.php file, but this doesn't appear to be working. I guess it's something to do with the panel functionality being managed elsewhere?

Has anyone been able to completely restrict access to the the panel (panel, panel/(:all)) successfully or knows how I'd go about doing this for a specific user role?

Thanks in advance!
