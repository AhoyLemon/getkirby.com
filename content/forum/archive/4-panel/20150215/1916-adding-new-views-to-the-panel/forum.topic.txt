Text: I'm struggling to find any documentation for customising the panel. I'm creating a site for a teacher to let them create worksheets for pupils. I've written the blueprints with no problems, and written the front-end, including a plugin to save user-data for the worksheets. What I now want to do is provide a way for her to review pupil performance from within the panel.

I've found from reading the source code how to add widgets - I already have one written to confirm that my data directory is writable. However, what I want to do is use a widget on the dashboard to provide a link to a customised view (+ controller). As far as I can tell from the source code, all routes are listed in `panel/app/routes/views.php` and the only way to change this is to edit that file directly, making updating trickier.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can achieve this? I understand that I could take the feature out of the panel, but I think it would create a more jarring experience.
