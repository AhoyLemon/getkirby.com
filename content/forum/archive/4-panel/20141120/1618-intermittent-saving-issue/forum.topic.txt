Text: Hello!

I am having some intermittent issues when I try to save updates to my site through the panel . Sometimes when I click save it lags for several minutes (5+) without saving. The button stays black, not ever getting to the green "Saved!" state, and the wheel in the top right just keeps turning. However, sometimes it saves right away like normal. Does anyone have any ideas why this could be happening? 

Thanks!
