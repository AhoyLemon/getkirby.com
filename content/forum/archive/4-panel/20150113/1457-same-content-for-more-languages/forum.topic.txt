Text: Is possible to "synchronize" some field content with all languages?

For example content like Amount, Birth day, Size, Price, Colors, Tags, ...  must be same for the all languages.

Exist by Blueprints some "validate" options or some like this to sync this info for all languages?

```
fields:
  amount:
    label: Amount
    type: number
    validate:
      language: en de

or 
    validate:
      language: all
```
