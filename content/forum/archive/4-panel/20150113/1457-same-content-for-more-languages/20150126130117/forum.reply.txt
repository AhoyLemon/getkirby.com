Text: I urgently need to document this. What will probably help is the following rule, which can be added to any field: 

```
somefield: 
  label: My field
  type: text
  translate: false
```

This will deactivate the field in all languages but the default language. So you can simply setup the value once in the default language and it will be locked. 

I hope this helps.
