Text: Would love to see something like that as well. Maybe you should post an issue on GitHub for better visibility.

I would extend it like this:

```
fields:
  amount:
    label: Amount
    type: number
    translation:
        en: standard
        de: lock
        es: copy
```

So we had en as standard lang (that could be removed), de would be uneditable (it has the same value as in EN), and for es, the value would be copied from en, but could be edited.
