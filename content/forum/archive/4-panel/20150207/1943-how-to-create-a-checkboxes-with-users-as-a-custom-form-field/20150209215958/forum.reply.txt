Text: Custom Authors Checkboxes Field:

/site/fields/authors/author.php

	<?php

	class AuthorsField extends CheckboxesField {

	  public function __construct() {
	    $this->type    = 'checkboxes';
	    $this->icon    = 'user';
	    $this->label   = l::get('fields.user.label', 'User');
	    $this->options = array();

	    foreach(kirby()->site()->users() as $user) {
	      if($user->hasRole('editor')) {
	        $this->options[$user->username()] = $user->username();
	      }
	    }

	  }

	}



For educational purposes:
Because the panel blueprint system didn't allow "options: users" (like it would with "options: files" or "options: children") for fields, I copied the "user" field from /panel/app/fields/user/user.php and created a custom field called "authors" at /site/fields/authors/authors.php.

Within the file, I changed it to extend the CheckboxesField instead of SelectField, and changed the type to checkboxes.. and to my surprise it just worked without any further struggle (thanks bastian!).


Edited the example above to filter 'editor' roles only.
