Text: Thanks for your answer. I had solved the problem by copying the user field and modifying it to only include the user type that I wanted, and then using that field in a structure, so I could add all the users I wanted that way. But your suggestion is what I wanted in the first place, so I'll go with that. A small edit is using the filterBy function instead of an 'if' condition:

```
<?php

class AuthorsField extends CheckboxesField {

  public function __construct() {
    $this->type    = 'checkboxes';
    $this->icon    = 'user';
    $this->label   = l::get('fields.user.label', 'User');
    $this->options = array();

    foreach(kirby()->site()->users()->filterBy('role', 'editor') as $user) {
        $this->options[$user->username()] = $user->username();
    }

  }

}
```
