Text: I am looking at this doc http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/custom-form-fields but I'm not sure how to accomplish what I'm after: I would like a form field that lets me select multiple users with the 'editor' role. So the values would be dynamic, not set in a blueprint. This field should be a list of checkboxes. 

Does anybody have experience with this?
