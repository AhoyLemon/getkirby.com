Text: When I try and use either a radio or select type in a blueprint Kirby crashes with the message that it can't find the class ArrayList in form.php If I put in the default: part it no longer crashes but I don't see any options.

Here's what my YAML looks like:

  herosize:
  	label: Hero Image Size
  	type: radio
  	default: L
    options:
      XL: Extra Large
      L: Large
      M: Medium
      S: Small 

Any ideas?
