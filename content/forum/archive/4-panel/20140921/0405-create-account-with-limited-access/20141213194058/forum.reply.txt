Text: Bastian,
  looking for same functionality as @chrishamamota - restricting user access to only those pages they created (in the panel). Basically, my students would logon, enter details of their project which is saved by Kirby to a txt file for rendering with my template.

Any update on 2.1 would be very welcome,
Rgds,
