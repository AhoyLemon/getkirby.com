Text: Hi,

I want to let my users of the panel (in a specific bleuprint) select a few users.
It's like an attendancce system. 

In the documentation (http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/panel-fields/checkboxes) I see you can have option queries (down on the page).

It looks interesting but:
* Can I use page: downloads?
That would show all users.
* Can I filter those users in any way? In the php code you allow 'filterby()', but that is what I need in the bleuprint...

Thanks for the support!
