Text: Thanks for your reply. Someone already issued this on github, but just in a per-blueprint way. Would be a good solution I think.

However I don't know how much of a problem this could become - concerning whitespace etc - as already pointed out by Bastian in the github issue.


To solve my needs for my client at the moment I implemented a specific "post-uploaded" hook to save the original filename in a custom field, and sent a pull request.
Not perfect, but now I display the custom field as filename in the frontend. In my use case that's acceptable right now.
