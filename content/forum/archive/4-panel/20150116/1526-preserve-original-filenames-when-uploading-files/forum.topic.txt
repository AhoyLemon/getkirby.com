Text: Hey,

Kirby converts the filename of uploaded files into a slugged version, e.g.

> Important Document.xls

becomes

> important-document.xls

For my current project it is crucial, that the files are displayed with their original filenames in the frontend.

Is there a solutions to this? Automatically saving the original filename in a custom field on file upload would be sufficient. But then, what if the filename gets changed through the panel?

We definitely need hooks integrated into the panel! ;)

Thanks
