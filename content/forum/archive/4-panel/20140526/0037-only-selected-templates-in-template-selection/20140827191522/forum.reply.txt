Text: But you can define the templates allowed for subpages quite easily without any hack. Have a look at the Panel docs:

(link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints/blueprint-variable)


> By default the editor can choose, which template to use for new subpages. If you would like to define a specific template, which will be used for supages you can do it like this:

    title: My Blueprint Title
    pages:
        template: mytemplate

To define multiple templates, simply write them as a list:

    title: My Blueprint Title
    pages:
    template: 
      - blogarticle
      - blogfeed
