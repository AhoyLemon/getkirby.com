Text: I'm new to Kirby, and pretty new to CMS in general. 
I have my site set up correctly. I am comfortable pushing changes to the site via git, but I want collaborators to be able to make changes through the panel.

How do I allow users to save content from the panel? How do I pull those changes back to my git repo, and local machine?
Do I need to set up a database?
