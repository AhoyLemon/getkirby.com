Text: @lydiastory on the production server you simply stage and commit all changes like you normally would:

```
git add -A 
git commit -am "changes made in the panel"
git push
```

On your local machine you pull them afterwards

```
git pull
```

It's basically a regular git workflow. Nothing fancy here :)
