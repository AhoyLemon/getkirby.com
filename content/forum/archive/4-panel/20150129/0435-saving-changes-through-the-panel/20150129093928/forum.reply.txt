Text: Hey @lydiastory,

the easiest setup is to have the origin on Github or Bitbucket or something similar and clone that on your local machine and on the production server. 

People can regularly update the site on the production server and you can still commit those changes manually with git and push them to the origin like you normally would. Afterwards you would just pull them in your local repo to get in sync with the production version.

You could automate this with a cronjob for example, so all content updates will be automatically committed and pushed to the origin every 10 minutes or so. This would also serve as a pretty decent backup solution. 

I hope this helps.
