Text: Hi, I am trying to make a Blueprint with instructions for the user in the grey column. I tried to use info, but It seems I can't get around adding a title field with accompanying unnecessary entry field, which will confuse the user. I don't want anything interactive in the grey column in this blueprint, as the next interactive step is in the white left hand column. No fields, no save button, just info. 

Any ideas? :-)
