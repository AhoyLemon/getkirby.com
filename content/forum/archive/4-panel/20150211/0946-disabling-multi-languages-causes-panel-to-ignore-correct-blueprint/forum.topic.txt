Text: I am currently working on a site that was initially going to go live with German and English versions, but for various reasons we are going to go live with German only first.

However, when I disable the English language in config.php, the Panel then ignores all the page .de.txt blueprints and reverts to some default (I assume one without the language extensions) and it does the same for the content.

Is this a known issue? Is there anyway I can force it to use the .de files?
