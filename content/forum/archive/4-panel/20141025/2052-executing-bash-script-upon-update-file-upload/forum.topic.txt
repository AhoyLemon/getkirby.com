Text: I consider myself competent with PHP, and very familiar with Kirby, but I'm pretty clueless about command line scripts, and how to integrate them.

Using Imagemagick, I'm working on a script that gets the average color from a certain portion of the image by cropping, resizing to 1x1px, and saving to a cache. A logo displayed on top of this corner of the photo changes its color to contrast with the image below.

I can write the bash script - but, I was wondering if there is a way tell kirby to execute it after a file upload, or any update to the content.

An alternative here is a cron that runs occasionally, but, for my client, I'd rather have this reflected immediately. Do I have any options?
