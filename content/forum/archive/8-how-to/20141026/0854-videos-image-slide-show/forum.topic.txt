Text: hello forum. I am very very new to Kirby. I have no idea how to ask this question in Kirby parlance so I will do my best.

Basically I want to know how to do if else logic:

IF videourl field has a  value -> Output video youtube embed using this value
ELSE are there images? is there more than one? yes? generate a slideshow
ELSE is there just one image? Output a single static image
ELSE do nothing

So basically i want it to test if a URL for a video has been supplied, if not, check for images and do a slideshow if there is more than one. If this is not true then just output a single static image. If those tests both fail, do nothing at all.

I am mainly a Textpattern developer and this is dead simple with TXP.

How do i pull this off please?

:)
