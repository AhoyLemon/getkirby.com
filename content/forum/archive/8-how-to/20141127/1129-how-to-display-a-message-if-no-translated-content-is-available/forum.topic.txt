Text: Hello everybody,

on our multi-language-site we have some pages which will not be translated and therefore is only available in the default language.

I would like to display a little message for visitors telling them, that there is unfortunately no translated content available.

How can I check within the template if the displayed page-content is the default language because there is no translation available?

Many thanks up front!
Tim
