Text: Hi! I created a webcomic template based off of the blog tutorial and it's so close to perfect - except for a pesky URL situation.

I wanted to have the most recent post show up upon loading the page, with the option to navigate prev/next first/last. Pretty basic.

It works great, but the URLs of the pages reorder every time I post, the most recent post always showing up as hayleypowers.com/ripples/page:1

I believe this is throwing off my disqus comments. Comments that should be on old pages just follow the '/page:1' url and migrate over to incorrect posts.

Here's my site link - let me know if I've explained myself well enough! <a href="http://hayleypowers.com/ripples/">http://hayleypowers.com/ripples/</a>
