Text: Hi, first thing, Nice site!!!

Second thing I was after a simple redirect myself and found that this worked. Just add only this code to your `home.php` and by visiting your sites url it will redirect it to the url of the latest post.
```
<?php
/* Redirect browser */
header("Location: " . $pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->flip()->first()->url());

exit;
?>

```
