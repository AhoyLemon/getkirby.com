Text: I have an url: `/projects`
It works in two languages English and Russian. English is default. Russian URL: ru/projects

I've changed URL in Russian by "URL-Key" param to "projekti".

Now `ru/projekti` works, but `ru/projects` â€” gives 404. How to redirect from `ru/projects` to the new URL?
