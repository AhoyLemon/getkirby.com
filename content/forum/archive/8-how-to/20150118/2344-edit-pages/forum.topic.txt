Text: This plugin lets you quickly access the edit screen of any page on the site. All you need to do is append `?edit` to the URL!

To use it, just pop it into a file in your /site/plugins/ folder.

    <?php 
    if(isset($_GET['edit'])){
        $slug = explode('?', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
        go(url('/panel/#/pages/show' . $slug[0]));
        exit();
    }
