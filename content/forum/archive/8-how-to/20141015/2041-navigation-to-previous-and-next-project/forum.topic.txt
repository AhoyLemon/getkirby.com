Text: Hi fellow kirby users,

I'm having some difficulties to find a correct solution to add some prev and next navigation between my projects.

Basically, I have a "projects" folder in which I have as many subfolders as projects :
- I display the projects in a grid form in my projects page
- When you click on the snapshot of the project, you are redirected to the project page
- In the project page I put "<<" and "">>" links which have to redirect to the previous (uid - 1) and next (uid + 1) projects.

I tried something like this in my project.php file :

<?php
$projects = $pages->find('projects')->children();
$current = $projects->findByURI($page->uri());
if ($current->hasPrev()) : $prevpage = $current->prev();
if ($current->hasNext()) : $nextpage = $current->next();
?>
The error I get is : Fatal error: Call to a member function uri() on a non-object

Any idea on my mistake or a correct way to perform that?

Many thanks for your help
