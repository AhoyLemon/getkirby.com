Has anyone built a "find the closest" type functionality in kirby? I've got a client who's website has a bunch of locations that people can go to, and i'm wanting to pull the gps latlgn from the various pages ($page->location()->lat()) so that I can search for the closest location from the address a user puts in.

So far in my research i've found the haversine 

```
    function getDistance($latitude1, $longitude1, $latitude2, $longitude2) {  
        $earth_radius = 6371;  
          
        $dLat = deg2rad($latitude2 - $latitude1);  
        $dLon = deg2rad($longitude2 - $longitude1);  
          
        $a = sin($dLat/2) * sin($dLat/2) + cos(deg2rad($latitude1)) * cos(deg2rad($latitude2)) * sin($dLon/2) * sin($dLon/2);  
        $c = 2 * asin(sqrt($a));  
        $d = $earth_radius * $c;  
          
        return $d;  
    }  
```
and I'm looking to figure out how to convert an address to a GPS co-ordinate. However my biggest question is, does someone already have a solution, and how would you go about searching the children and grandchildren of a page for the closest one based on the haversine.
