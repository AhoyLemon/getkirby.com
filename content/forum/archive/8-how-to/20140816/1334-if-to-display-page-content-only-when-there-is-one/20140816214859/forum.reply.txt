Text: So if I understand correctly, you want to hide that whole block if there's no content in the site title tag? (Would be a little easier to figure out with the actual code).

If that's correct, do this:

```php
<?php if($site->title() != ''): ?>
    <div class="page-content-box">
    etc.
<?php endif ?>
```
