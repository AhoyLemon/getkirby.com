Text: I have my layout like this:

div class = page-content-box
   site title tag
   site content tag
/div

and I need to wrap an if around the whole div along with the site title tag and site content tag. And I want the if to hide all the div and content within if there is no text written.

So:

php if
div class="page-content-box"
   site title tag
   site content tag
/div
close if

I know that along with the site content tag there will be no title tag - and that's what I need :-)

Thanks
