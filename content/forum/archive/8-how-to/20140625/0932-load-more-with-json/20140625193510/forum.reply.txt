Text: Okay, after discussing my request with a few colleagues I encountered a few problems I haven't thought of. Most especially: Getting some sort of a post variable in order to check which / how many posts have already been loaded and what else needs to be loaded. You know what I mean?

The great folks at (link: http://minml.co/ text: MinmlCo popup: yes) (Lovely site, lovely stuff) did exactly that from what I see in their source code. They've used an amount- and an offset-variable in their JS script:

    var amount = 2;
    var offset = amount * 3;
    function loadMore(){
    $.ajax({
    url : 'ajax',
    type : 'post',
    dataType : 'json',
    data : {
    'amount' : amount,
    'offset' : offset
    }
    }).done(function(data){
    $('.show_more').parent().before(data[0]);
    $('.new').fadeIn();
    if(!data[1]){
    $('.show_more').unbind('click', loader);
    $('.show_more').attr('href', '#contact');
    $('.show_more').click(function(){wow = new WOW({animateClass: 'animated',offset:100});wow.init();});
    $('.show_more').html('I want to work with you');
    }
    });
    offset += amount * 3;
    }

Still, being the noob I am: Not that sure how to actually write the PHP (template) for that jQuery function now.

**Any insights?**
