Text: @ChrisjMartin87 , thank you so much for the reply, the code and for not being cheesed off by me. Yet ;-)

Unfortunately still fiddling: Posts are loaded via AJAX, but clicking the "load_more" button does not cause prior posts being loaded.

Console's fine, but network gives an empty (?) response {"1":0,"0":""} i. e. no content is transmitted comparing to MinmlCo. So I'm fiddling where to / how to get the content over to the site.

My modified code (**Work in progress**) can be viewed (link: https://github.com/NECKRHINOS/load-more.git text: over at GitHub popup: yes). All contributors are _very_ welcome!
