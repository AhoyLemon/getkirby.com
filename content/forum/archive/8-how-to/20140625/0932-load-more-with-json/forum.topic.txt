Text: Hello there

Well, I've made a blog with posts loaded via JSON as explained (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/json text: in the article from 2012 popup: yes). So far, everything's fine and working.

However, I want to load more i. e. older posts by clicking on a link. You know, that kind of endless scroll-thing but by actively clicking.

I've tried some doodling and sort of have in mind what should be done - But can someone provide some snippets of code, please? :) I'm really stuck.
