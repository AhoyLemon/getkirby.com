Text: Hi everybody,

I am looking for a way to extend the panel functionality. I want to dynamically generate form input fields (text) for all images of the pages that have a certain blueprint. 

For example:

- user uploads 3 images(img1.png, img2.jpg, img3.jpg)
- panel page reloads after each upload
- displays one text input field for each image
- when saving the page, the text for the image is saved in a meta-data file (img1.png.txt, img2.jpg.txt, img3.jpg.txt).

How could I best approach this?
