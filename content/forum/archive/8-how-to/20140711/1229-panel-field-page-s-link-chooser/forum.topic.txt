Text: Hi !
I just made a small custom field letting my users choose a link by choosing a page.
I had two reasons for this :
1- My users are not always good with links and URLs. It's easier for them to choose a page.
2- When working locally, I can't use the validator: URL, because he want an extension like .com, .org, etc.

Their is just an issueâ€¦ When saving a page with a link in it, the UID of the desination's page is saved and used for generating the link. If the destination's page URL is modified, the page need to be saved again to modify the UID.

Feel free to propose improvements !
