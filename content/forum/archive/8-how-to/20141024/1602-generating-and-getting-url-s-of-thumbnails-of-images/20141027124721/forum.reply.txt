Text: You can use the option false with the thumb function to just output a URL: 
```php 
<?php echo thumb($page->images()->first(), array('width' => 100), false) ?>
```

As regards the thumbs themselves, I think they are sort of generated "on the fly" when the thumb function is used; so that means, as soon as you use thumb(), the thumbs will be there and can be addressed as above.
