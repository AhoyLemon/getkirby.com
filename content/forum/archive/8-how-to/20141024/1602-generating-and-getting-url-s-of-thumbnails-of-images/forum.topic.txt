Text: Hello. 

I realise that, kirby does not generate thumbnails of images that uploaded via panel. 

It's only generating when you list images in panel. 

Is it a bug? 

And the other and real question is; how can I access that thumbnails URL's? 

Is there a function like: $page->images()->first()->$thumnail->$url or sth like that?

Thank you.
