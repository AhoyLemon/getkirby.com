Text: I have seen quite a number of cart/shop attempts in this forum and all of them are quite complicated to archive, so i was thinking to give something back to the community as well. At least if your shop is running with paypal as payment processor. For simplicity this will do...

So my attempt is with using the mini cart js which can be found here:
(link: minicartjs.com text: minicartscript)

There are several simple and advanced ways to implement this script. We'll go for the beginner route to get people running...

Download the script or embed directly into your template file of your choice.

```
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/minicart/3.0.5/minicart.min.js"></script>
<script>
    paypal.minicart.render();
</script>
```

Modify Paypal Button. Create a new one at paypal, copy it's code to your template file to where it is supposed to appear

```
<form method="post" action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_cart">
<input type="hidden" name="add" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="business" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="item_name" value="Baseball Hat">
<input type="hidden" name="item_number" value="123">
<input type="hidden" name="amount" value="5.95">
<input type="hidden" name="shipping" value="1.00">
<input type="hidden" name="shipping2" value="0.50">
<input type="hidden" name="handling" value="2.00 ">
<input type="hidden" name="currency_code" value="USD">
<input type="hidden" name="return" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="undefined_quantity" value="1">
<input type="image" src="http://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/x-click-but22.gif" border="0" name="submit" width="87" height="23" alt="Make payments with PayPal - it's fast, free and secure!">
</form>
```

Replace all values like "item_name", "item_number" as well as shopping, currency, "return" value with 

```
<? php echo $page->title() ?>
<? echo $page->price() ?>
etc... 
...
```

You might want to check out this tutorial first:
http://getkirby.com/docs/variables/page

Lastly, include the following script on your return page:

```
<script>
    paypal.minicart.reset();
</script>
```

Now you are all set. The documentation on their site is pretty self-explainatory. If you know how to work with the variables and just the very basics ( i guess anyone using kirby got the requirements already ) of php. Then this is a quick and easy, but still working and beautiful way to run a shop.
