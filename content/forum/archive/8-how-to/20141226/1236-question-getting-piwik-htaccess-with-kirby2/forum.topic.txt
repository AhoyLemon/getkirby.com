Text: So i've installed piwik and set it up in my website and have it running tied to the database etc. However I can't seem to get it to track, and the issue seems to be a .htaccess with kirbys modrewrite not allowing kirby to touch the piwik.php tracking file. I've tried to figure it out myself but had zero luck. I hope one of you fine people have gotten this working and could perhaps share with me how you do it.
