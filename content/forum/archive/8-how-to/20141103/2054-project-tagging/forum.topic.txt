Text: Hello to You all,
I've started using Kirby few day ago and to be honest I'm also just starting with php.  Nonetheless I've almost managed to make my small site but I'm stuck with one thing.
On my site I have 3 page. "Text", "Graphics" and "Paintings". Some of them (e.g. a panting and a graphic) are made  as a part of one bigger project, so I would like to tag them accordingly and have a tag cloud for filtering.
That's what I have so far.(from the Kirby documentation):

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/68920599@N03/15703954045" title="Screen Shot 2014-11-03 at 22.19.42 by StanisÅ‚aw Ignaciuk, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3955/15703954045_cb3b96843c_o.png" width="492" height="232" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-03 at 22.19.42"></a>

I don't know what I should do now to have a page with a filter content of my site and the process to be somehow automated.

Thanks for help
and
sorry if my english is too poor to describe my problem.
Cheers
