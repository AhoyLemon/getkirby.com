Text: Kind of.  So far I have it working so that the text file can have a dated name, like 2015-01-20-my-post and not just blogarticle.txt. That's a good start, because at least I can search them. But, I haven't worked out have to have all those text files just in one folder. At the moment, the structure is:

01-blog/
     2015-01-20-post-name/
        2015-01-20-post-name.txt

The folder with the post name is redundant, of course, but I haven't been messing around with it for long. Maybe I need to change something in the PHP loop somewhere. Also, the sub-menu in the navigation is picking up all the blog posts, which I need to turn off.

Did either of you have any luck with this?
