Text: I'd like to replicate the URLs of my Wordpress export that's currently in a Jekyll build. The way Kirby is structured, I currently have to name a folder inside the /blog directory with the name and, possibly, date of the post: /blog/2014-11-06-my-blog-post/article.txt

The downside with this is that I have hundreds of text files called article.txt, which makes searching for and working with them locally a pain. I'd prefer the blog folder to mirror Jekyll's structure, in which the name of the text file is part of the URL: /blog/2014-11-06-my-blog-post.txt

Is this possible? Can I used the chronological page listing approach for this instead or will it be a pain to set up a blog structure this way?
