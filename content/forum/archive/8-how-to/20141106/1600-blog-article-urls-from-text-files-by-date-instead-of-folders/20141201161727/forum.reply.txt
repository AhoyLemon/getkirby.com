Text: Thanks for the reply, that's very helpful to know. So assuming my default template was the blog post template and all other pages would have something else, I would have a structure like this:


-- posts
   -- 2014-11-29-an-article-url
   -- 2014-12-01-slug-line-for-another
   -- etc.

-- 01-my-great-page
  -- article.txt

-- 02-my-next-great-page
  -- article.txt

Does that sound right?

(Sorry, had to use double dashes to stop them being formatted as bullet points)

Best,
