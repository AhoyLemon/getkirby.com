Text: I edit and manage my photos in Adobe Lightroom. And I have a rather vast collection of daily images in Lightroom already organized in folders with this format: 
Generic: year-month-day Long or short title with spaces
Example: 2014-07-20 Trip to Honolulu

Right now it's easy to publish my images to Google Plus photos (formerly Picasa). I would like to publish them to a Kirby content folder instead, but keep my Lightroom foldername structure.

**Question:**
Is it possible to change Kirbys default "number-title" sorting function to use "year-month-day Title"?
And still have a usable $date and $title variable?

How or where do I look?

A separate plugin solution would be great but editing the core functions will also work for me.
