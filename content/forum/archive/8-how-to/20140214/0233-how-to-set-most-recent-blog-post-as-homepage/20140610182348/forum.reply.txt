Text: Oh, actually that won't work either because you have PHP tags inside PHP tags. So more like this, I think.

```php
<?php
/* Redirect browser */
header("Location: " . $pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->flip()->first()->url());

exit;
?>
```

Here's my redirect template where I'm pulling a specific field for a redirect.

```php
<?php
    header( "Location: " . $page->redirect() );
    exit;
?>
```
