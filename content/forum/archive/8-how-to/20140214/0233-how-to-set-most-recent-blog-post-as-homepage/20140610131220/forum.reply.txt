Text: The only trouble with this method is the url. It will still show as www.mysite.com rather than the actual url of the post ie www.mysite.com/blog/this-is-my-post

This is important for when someone would share the post because as soon as a new post is made that link is wrong that would have been shared.

So rather than editing the home.php to show the latest post, is there a way to redirect www.mysite.com to the latest post rather than just showing the content of it?

Many thanks.
