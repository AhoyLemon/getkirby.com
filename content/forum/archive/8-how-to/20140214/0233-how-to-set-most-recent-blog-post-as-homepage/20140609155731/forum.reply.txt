Text: Ok sorry to keep going over the same thing. I have done what is mentioned, but it just shows a text link to the post, not the full page of the post. Ideally I want it so when you go to www.webpage.com it redirects to the latest post at www.webpage.com/blog/latest-post.

I used to get this done in WordPress by adding some code to the functions.php you can see the method [here - WordPress redirect to latest post](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/only-show-latest-post-and-comments-on-front-page).

Any help would be great, thanks.
