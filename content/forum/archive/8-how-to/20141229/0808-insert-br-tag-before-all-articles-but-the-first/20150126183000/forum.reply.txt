Text: Building on what @texnixe said, you could use CSS to target the elements by using `:nth-child()` like so:

```CSS
article:nth-child(n+2) {
    margin-top: 2em;
    color: red; 
}
```

Added `color: red;` so we can easily see what articles the rule is currently being applied to.

For more variations checkout (link: http://nthmaster.com   text: Mastering the :nth-child). Hope that helps.
