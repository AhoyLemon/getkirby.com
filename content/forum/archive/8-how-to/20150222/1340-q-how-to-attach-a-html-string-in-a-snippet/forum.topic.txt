Text: Unfortunately I am ultimate newbee to php, with kirby I started learning (and loving) php :)

Now i have a specific question
I got following line
```
<?php echo $page->dokumentlink()->html() ?>
```

And I want an arrow (â†’) or any html element to be attached at very end of this output, specificaly things from fontawesom.io. like
```
<i class="fa fa-share"></i>
```

now, what is the most correct way to "inject" it into php line so that output would work as wished?

Thanks in advance! :)
