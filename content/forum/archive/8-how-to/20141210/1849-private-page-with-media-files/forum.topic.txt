Text: I would like to set up some private pages accessible to frontend users only after login. 
For simple text-bases pages that is easily done using the authentication methods that come with kirby.

However, there is a kind of security issue if other media files (e.g. images) are included in the page. Usually, the image would be stored within the page's folder (or somewhere else within content). However, while the page text (say, "private.txt" with an according template "private.php" that ensures access only after log in) is protected by unauthorized access, this is not true for the images. If the full path of the image is known, it could be accessed by typing the according url directly into the browser, even without being logged in.

I believe it should be possible to prevent access to the image file by placing the image somewhere outside of the content folder and grant access only via php script, somehow circumventing the built-in protection against direct access to files outside of content.

However, before I start to implement such a method, as anyone stumbled over this problem and found a solution to it?

I am using the latex kirby 2.0.x version.
