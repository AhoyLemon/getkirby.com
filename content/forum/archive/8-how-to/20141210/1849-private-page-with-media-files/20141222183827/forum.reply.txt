Text: I recently worked on something similar to what you are asking about. My client uses Amember to manage memberships for digital training products and we rebuilt the site using kirby. We needed URL's to the products that would expire after a given time frame to stop people from sharing the links to video's and other files. 

We ended up using Amazon AWS to host the files and linking to them through cloudfront (for speed). We used AWS's access control and I built a little module in Kirby that created links that expired. Perhaps something similar with URL's to your files could work. The downside is the files are not seen by the kirbyCMS so they have to be added via a text field instead of having kirby automatically list things, but it worked quite well for this particular case.
