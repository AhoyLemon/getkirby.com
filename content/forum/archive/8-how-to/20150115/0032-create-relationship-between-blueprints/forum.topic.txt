Text: Hello there, I want to use Kirby for the first time, but I need to know if it is possible to work with relationships between post-types/blueprints...

The only way is using tags?

I want to develop a website that have 3 types of content: profiles, locations and events

**events** is always connected to one profile and one location.

What do you suggest?

Thanks!
