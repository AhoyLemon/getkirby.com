Text: Hi,

is it possible to remove the language code from the generated URLs? I tried setting the 'url' key to '/' on both languages (de and en). The generated URLs in the menu work correct but I get an error when trying to access pages that are not in the default language. Those are only accessible by the language-code in front of the URL-key.

Thanks for your help!
Tim
