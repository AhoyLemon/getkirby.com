Text: @texnixie Thank you very much for your answer. I'm still unclear how I can get that to out put links in my 'latest' footer section. My HTML looks like this:

              <div class="footer-latest">

                    <h6>Latest</h6>

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="">Article</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">Article</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">Article</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </div>

How can I use the code you've suggested to output the post titles and link to the correct page?

I am a php and kirby noob, thanks in advance for your help!
