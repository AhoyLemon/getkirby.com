Text: I see, the yaml output generated by the structure field via the panel is different from my manual yaml file, that's why it doesn't work. 

Anyway, there is a workaround:

```php
<?php 
    $testimonials= (page('testimonials')->testimonials()->yaml());
    shuffle($testimonials);
   $testimonials= (new Collection($testimonials))->limit(3);
?>
```
