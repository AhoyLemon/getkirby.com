Text: Hi,

i'm using structured data input on an extra page and will output it on other pages. I'll use it for testimonials.

Currently I use type: structure and in the template I use:

```
<?php foreach (page('testimonialslider')->testimonials()->yaml() as $testimonal): ?>
	<li>
                 <blockquote>"<?php echo $testimonal['testimonial'] ?>"
                             <span><?php echo $testimonal['author'] ?></span>
                </blockquote>
	</li>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

It works very well, but i would like to use limit() and shuffle(). Is it possible on structured data? If i put it after yaml() it does nothing and before yaml() i've no output...

Thx
Huaba
