This is the markdown for one testimonial on the page:

```
-
Testimonials: - 
  testimonial: >
    Text from the client
    and so on
  author: 'Name of the client'
- 
```

And the blueprint:

```
  testimonials:
    label: Testimonials
    type: structure
    entry: >
      <em>Text:</em> {{testimonial}}<br />
      <em>Author:</em> {{author}}
    fields:
      testimonial:
        label: Testimonial
        type: text
      author:
        label: Author
        type: text
```
