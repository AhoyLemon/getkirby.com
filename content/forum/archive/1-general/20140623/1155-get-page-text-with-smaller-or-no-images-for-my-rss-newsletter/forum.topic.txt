Text: I need the `$page->text()` with all embedded images rendered to 800px width.

Background: I have tried to set up a Newsletter for my blog. I tried the RSS-newsletter features of (link: http://mailchimp.com/ text: Mailchimp) and (link: https://feedpress.it/ text: Feedpress). Both have the same issue. 

My newsletter usualy has a width of 800px. If my blogpost includes an image with 1200*800, it will expand my newsletter to a width of 1200px, so the recipient has to scroll horizontaly. My goal is to have all images in my rss-feed scaled down to 800px width tops.

Any idea how to do this?
