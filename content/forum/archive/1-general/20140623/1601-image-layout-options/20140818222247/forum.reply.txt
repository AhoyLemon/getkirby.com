I had the same issue but took a different approach. Not sure if it is the best one but it (sort of) worked for me. Each page with a custom layout has a subpage/directory for each part of the page. In each director are the images for that part and text file with variables. One of the variables describes the layout that should be used for the images.

The full page is then a combination of the different layouts.

It is a bit complex but I can layout the page in any combination I want and reorder them when needed (by reordering the directories).
