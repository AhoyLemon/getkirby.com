Text: I have a unique problem (probably) in displaying the imagery in my portfolio built with Kirby. For each project I have an unknown number of images that I'd like to control the layout of with a few options; either an image on its own, 2 images side by side, or 3 side by side by side. The HTML is already taken care of, I just need a way to define that layout and loop through the images properly.

So... do I either;

a) Name images with a prefix and filter them when pulling them out (e.g. 1_image1.jpg, 2_image2.jpg, 2_image3.jpg, etc)

or

b) Define a variable, something like; Layout: 1,1,2,1,3,1,2 and try and loop through all the images at the same time as looping through that array and slot them in to the right places?

What would you do, Kirby-ites?
