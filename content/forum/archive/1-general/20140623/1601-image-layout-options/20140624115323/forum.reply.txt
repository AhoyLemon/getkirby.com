Text: Whatever's easier! I didn't want to have to think to much - just throw some images in a folder and let it sort itself out automatically, but with some control - masonry-ish.

I think, actually, an even easier way to do it is to have a kirbytext() field and just list out the images. I've got to write a (picture:) plugin for my responsive images, so I may as well write a (picture_grid:1.jpg,2.jpg) version that spits out the surrounding layout grid and the images.

I can then control what goes where, just with a little more effort on my part to add the filenames to the .txt file.

Unless anyone has a better solution?
