Text: Hi,

There's a writeup on passing variables from your template to your snippet, but is there a method of retrieving them from the snippet for use in the template?

http://getkirby.com/docs/snippets

I've tried using the c::set/get variables in the config.php to set specific pages, using $pages->find('').. and I've tried adding the variables to the header snippet..

Using c::get('VAR')->children()->visible() doesn't work to get page..

And a variable set in header snippet is non existent in the template.

I don't want to have to declare a long list of variables at the top of each template file like I am presently doing and am seeking a way of cleaning up the process via a single file.

Can I do so using clean, kirby type method to achieving this goal?
