Text: Ok, I'm a bit confused. Because if you just want everything on one page, i.e. the home page, you only need the home.php template and the projects.php snippet and nothing else (apart from an error page and an imprint maybe).

Then you can leave the home.php as is, and in the projects.php snippet, you would put the following code:

```
<?php

$projects = "page('projects')->children()->visible();

foreach ($projects as $project) : 
    if($images = $project->images): ?>
 
//all the stuff you want to output here ....

<?php endif; endforeach ?>
```

Hope this helps, if not, maybe you can explain in more detail what you want to achieve.

And in the default.php you would put a redirect to the start page.
