Text: thanks. this is my first time not just laying out my page in straight html with css, so I'm a bit new.  i didn't think i needed the extra templates, but was working with the starter kit.  I've cleaned everything up and amended the snippets/projects.php, but the image blog still wont load, and the page now stops loading content beyond the header. ill keep trying but this seems so simple yet i can't figure out what I'm missing.

I guess in more detail, i quite literally would like to replicate the structure of the blog layout from this site: http://istvanvasil.com 

where there is a title, then project text, followed by images, and then the next project title, text, images, etc..

I would think that having the content folder set up the way i do

content/1-projects/
1-project1
2-project2
3-project3

and then just having a simple home page pulling a header/body/footer with the body being the projects just displayed in the order posted would be achievable with the tiniest bit of knowledge in kirby, but i am struggling here to get it to work, so i truly appreciate your help so far.

here is my revised templates/home.php

      <?php snippet('header') ?>
      <?php snippet('projects') ?>
      <?php snippet('footer') ?>

and here is my revised snippets/projects.php

      <main class="projects" role="main">
      <?php

      $projects = "page('projects')->children()->visible();

      foreach ($projects as $project) : 
          if($images = $project->images): ?>

      <?php endif; endforeach ?>
      </main>


I think i would want the displayed content code to look like:

      <section id="projects">

	
       <div class="project">
     	
            <div class="project_description">
        
                <span class="title">
                  Project Titles          </span>
		    
               <p class="description">
                  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.          </p>

              </div>

  
         <div class="project_images">

          <ul>
                 <li><img class="lazy" src="assets/images/circle.gif" data-original="http://where the image is located" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" /></li>
                 <li><img class="lazy" src="assets/images/circle.gif" data-original="http://where the image is located" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" /></li>
                 <li><img class="lazy" src="assets/images/circle.gif" data-original="http://where the image is located" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" /></li>
                 <li><img class="lazy" src="assets/images/circle.gif" data-original="http://where the image is located" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" /></li>
               </ul>		

            
         </div>
