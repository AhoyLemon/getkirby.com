Im having some trouble (for sure because I'm very new to this) setting up a super simple project blog.  Id just like to have the site open my header and footer and then have a running blog of projects between, with a title, some text, and some images, and then the next project would come right after, etc. I can get the home.php template set up to have my header and footer, but i cannot get the project blog to properly display in the body ever.  I don't want these to be linked articles, with Read More buttons, but the full display of each projects data.

I would think this would be similar to the solution example for the one pager, but it doesn't seem to work for me at all, and I would want a lot less parts than that solution too.  Essentially if the one pager solution guide only had projects, and they were displayed in a vertical blog, with all the projects expanded and on display and no need to click anywhere.. similar to this site: http://istvanvasil.com

I would think i could figure this out, but I cannot understand how to set up the home.php template and refer to the projects properly.. and the few times I get an image to show up it seems outside of the CSS style sheet that would have it centered in the page (again similar to this example site: http://istvanvasil.com)

thanks for any help at all, and my apologies for such a novice issue/inability.
