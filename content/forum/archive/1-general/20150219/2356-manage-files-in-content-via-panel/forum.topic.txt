Text: Hey folks,

Is there a way to manage files within the root of the `/content` folder via the panel?

Looks like `$site` has some ways to work specifically with files within this folder:
- (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/site/images   text: $site->images())
- (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/site/image    text: $site->image($filename = false))

But I'd like to allow user to manage via the panel.  These files wouldn't be associated with any specific page but would be used as shared, modifiable assets.
