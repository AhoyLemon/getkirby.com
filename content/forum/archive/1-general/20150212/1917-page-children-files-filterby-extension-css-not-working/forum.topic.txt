Text: I'm trying to get a list of css files for each of the child pages to print on the parent page. I've been using the following:

    <script>
    // call lower-priority CSS after HTML is fully loaded
    $(document).ready(function() {
    	if($("body").size()>0){
    		if (document.createStyleSheet) {
    			<?php $children_css = $page->children()->files()->filterBy('extension', 'css'); ?>
    			<?php foreach ($children_css as $child_css) { ?>
    			document.createStyleSheet('<?php echo $child_css->url(); ?>');
    			<?php } // end foreach ?>
    		}
    	}
    });
    </script>

As you can see, I'm specifically trying to get a collection of the page's children's css files with this:

    $page->children()->files()->filterBy('extension', 'css')

When I use that code, it looks like the PHP just breaks completely and stops printing html.

I tried simplifying the code to only display the parent page's css files:

    <?php
    	$children = $page->files()->filterBy('extension', 'css');
    	foreach ($children as $child_files) {
    		echo $child_files->url();
    	}
    ?>

This works just fine, but I'd really like to get a css listing of the parent page's child pages.

Any ideas?
