Text: Not sure, but are you sure you can use children()->files()? This shape looks a little weird to me.

Maybe try:

```
$childrenpages = $page->children();
$childrenCSS = array();
foreach ($childrenpages as $child): {
foreach ($child->files()->filterBy('extension', 'css') as $sheet): {
$childrenCSS[] = $sheet;
};
};
```

As such, $childrenCSS is meant to be a progressively built collection of all the css pages in the children of your current page. You should then be able to use it to build your css.

Hope this helps.
