Text: I've altered the kirbytext image tag to basically force a thumbnail and a max width and height of 1024px. You can rename this file thumb.php before placing it under /site/tags/thumb.php and also change ```kirbytext::$tags['image']``` to ```kirbytext::$tags['thumb']``` it might actually be better instead of actively opting-out of the kirbytext image tag, as that should be solved on a higher level.
