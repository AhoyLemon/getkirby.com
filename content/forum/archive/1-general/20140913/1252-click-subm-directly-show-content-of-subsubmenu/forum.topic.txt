**Click submenu item & directly display the content of the first item from the subsubmenu?**

Hi there! 
For my site, I use the standard Kirby _main menu_, the _sub menu_ and the _independent sub sub menu_.

<http://getkirby.com/blog/fun-with-menus>

###Is it possible to directly display the content of the **first** _**sub sub** menu_ item (and to set this item to active)? Without displaying the content of the first _**sub** menu_ item!


I'll try to explain it:

**My folder structure**

01-locations
--- 01-stage-one
--- 02-stage-two
--- 03-stage-three

02-schedule
--- 01-play-one
-------- 01-about
-------- 02-actors
-------- 03-tickets
--- 02-play-two
--- 03-play-three

03-about
--- 01-item-one
--- 02-item-two


**Kirby default menu behavior:**

- First click on **"schedule"** opens the _"submenu"_ and displays the _"schedule content"_

- Second click on **"play one"** opens the _"sub-sub-menu"_ and displays the _"play one content"_



And this is exactly my problem: 

I do not want to load the contents of _"play one content"_. But directly the content of _"about"_.

Logically, then, the first sub sub item must be active!



**So it should be:**

- First click on **"schedule"** opens the _"submenu"_ and displays the _"schedule content"_

- Second click on **"play one"** opens the _"sub-sub-menu"_ and set the first item active (about) and displays the _"about content"_

I have no idea how I can address the _"about"_ menu item directly!


I hope you understand my problem. Otherwise I have to explain it again! And thanks for any help!
