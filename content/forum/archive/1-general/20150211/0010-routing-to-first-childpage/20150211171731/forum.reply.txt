Text: I had something similar in my code,

```
<?php echo $page->children()->first()->url() ?>
```

that should always grab the first child page, is that what your looking for? You can use if statements to go deeper.

You should try 

```
'pattern' => 'archive',
'action'  => function() {
    return go('$page->children()->first()->url()');
}
```
