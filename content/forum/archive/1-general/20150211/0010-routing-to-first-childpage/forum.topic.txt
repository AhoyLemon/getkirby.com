Text: I am trying to set up a dynamic route but it simply won’t work at all. Maybe you guys can help me!

I have some kind of archive with many child-pages. When clicking the ARCHIVE the user should be redirected to the first child. Since the first child might change, I need this route to be dynamic.


Here’s what I have:

c::set('routes', array(
  array(
    'pattern' => 'archive',
    'action'  => function() {
		return go('archive/» HERE GOES THE FIRST CHILD ?! «');
	}
  )
));


THX!
