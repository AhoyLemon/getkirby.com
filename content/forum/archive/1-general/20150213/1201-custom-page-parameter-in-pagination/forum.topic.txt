Text: Hello everyone I would like to ask how to rename the parameter
````
page
````

in http://localhost/page:2/?q=This+is+a+search+query.

i.e. 

http://localhost/hello:2/?q=This+is+a+search+query 

for it not to mess up with tag-filter..
but it would be better if it would look like this

http://localhost/?q=This+is+a+search+query&page=2
