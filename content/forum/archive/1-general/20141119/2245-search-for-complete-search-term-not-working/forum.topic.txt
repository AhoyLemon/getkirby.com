Text: When using the built in Kirby search feature I always get results for part of my search term. For instance, when I search for "new user" I get results for pages that contain "new" and "user". However, I only want results that have the complete search term on it. 

On http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/page/search , I think it says that by adding array('words' => true) to the search it should give me only the full search term results, but it's not working for me.

Am I overlooking something?
