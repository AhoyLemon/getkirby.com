Text: `<?php $test = page('somepage'); ?>`only works if the page is in the root level of the content folder, so it won't work if "somepage" is a subpage. You can however specify a path :

```php
<?php $test = page('page/subpage');?>
```

From anywhere, this seems to work:

```php
 <?php $test = $site->index()->findbyURI('somepage'); echo $test->title();?>
```
