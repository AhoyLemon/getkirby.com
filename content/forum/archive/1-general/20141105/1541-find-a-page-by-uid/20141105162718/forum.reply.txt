Text: Thanks for your thoughts, your first two suggestions offer no solution because those use a wrong syntax (well non documented anyway ;-). I generally find that objects and arrays are easily tested with Kirby. But I did:

    gettype($site->find('subpage-a'))

That gave me: boolean
So that seems somewhat unexpected?
