Text: Hi,

Lately I try to change thumbnails folder. by following this tutorial

http://getkirby.com/docs/advanced/customized-folder-setup

after create site.php on root folder with this code:

    $kirby = kirby();
    $kirby->roots->thumbs = $kirby->roots()->index() . DS . 'thumbnails';
    $kirby->urls->thumbs  = $kirby->urls()->index() . '/thumbnails';

its work great. Kirby create thumbnails folder  http://localhost/kirby/thumbnails and all thumbnails image are generated there.

but once I try to alter into:
    $kirby = kirby();
    $kirby->roots->thumbs = $kirby->roots()->content() . DS . 'thumbnails';
    $kirby->urls->thumbs  = $kirby->urls()->content() . '/thumbnails';

kirby return value is:
    <img src="http://localhost/kirby/content/3-gallery/content-url/thumbnail.jpg" alt="">

meanwhile what i'm looking for is:
    <img src="http://localhost/kirby/content/3-gallery/content-url/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg" alt="">

is there something that i missed? 

thank You
