Text: Hello,

I'm working on a website which is an extensive list of items (600+), each of them assigned to certain categories (title, publishing-date, author, etc.). To feed that list, I thought about using the Kirby CMS due to its simple folder/.txt structure and having each item as one post/page.

To set up and simplify the maintenance of this list + keeping an overview, I was wondering if I could store all posts/pages in one .txt and have Kirby reading it out. 

Such as:
Item 1
Title: Title Item 1
Author: Author Item 1
…
Item 2
Title: Title Item 2
Author: Author Item 2
…

Alternatively, does Kirby necessarily need a folder per page or could I just create a folder full of .txt's, each of them representing one page?

One more thing, probably a silly question, could I, somehow, use a table, such as a Google spreadsheet to feed Kirby?

Thanks!
