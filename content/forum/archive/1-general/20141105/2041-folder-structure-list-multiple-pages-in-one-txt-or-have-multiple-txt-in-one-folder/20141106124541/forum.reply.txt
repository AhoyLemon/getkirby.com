Text: Thanks for your replies. The idea of one complete list (or one .txt file) would also be to keep the inventory in the backend easier to overview and edit. (Basically programming a direct "html" translation of rows and columns)

I will look into the structured data input. At the moment, the content is stored in a google spreadsheet with around 600 rows and 5 columns. Best would be of course to have a way of reading out this existing table?
