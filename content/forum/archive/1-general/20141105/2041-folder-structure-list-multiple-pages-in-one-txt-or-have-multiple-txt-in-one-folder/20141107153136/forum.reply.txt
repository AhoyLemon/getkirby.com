I'm not familiar with the Google API so far and my php-skills don't go further than Kirby's given structures, but I found some scripts working on the same, such as this (link: http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/json-google-spreadsheets/ text: Getting JSON out of Google Spreadsheets).

This script seems to go through a Google Spreadsheet and outputs every row as an array of data from each column. Such as:
```
[
    {
        "animal": "Giraffe",
        "favoriteFood": "Peaches",
        "isFluffy": "Not so much",
        "likesFishes": "Probably",
        "id": 0
    },
    {
        "animal": "Koala",
        "favoriteFood": "Huckleberries",
        "isFluffy": "Mostly",
        "likesFishes": "Probably",
        "id": 1
    }
], ...
```
Could I use these arrays to say something like
```
<?php foreach $array as $row ?>
- Do stuff for label 1
- Do stuff for label 2
- Do stuff for label 3...
<?php endforeach ?>
```

This probably hasn't too much to do with Kirby anymore, but thanks for any help.
