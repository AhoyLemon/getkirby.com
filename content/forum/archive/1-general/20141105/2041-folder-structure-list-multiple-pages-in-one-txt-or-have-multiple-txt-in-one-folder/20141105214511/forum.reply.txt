Text: You can't have hundreds of txt-files in one folder. One way of doing it in one file would be to use structured content as described here: http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/panel-fields/structure and then create a new page from each entry. Should work, I guess. Don't know performance-wise though.

How is the content currently stored?
