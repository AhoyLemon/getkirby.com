Text: Hey @texnixe,

Thanks, your answer on http://getkirby.com/forum/general/20141105/find-a-page-by-uid already helped me out to solve this one.

In case somebody needs this:
Small adjustment, we are not searching in first level directories, so we have to specify the path, `get('in')` is the value of the dropdown.

```
$results = page('files/recent/'. get('in'))->search(get('q'))->visible()
```
