Text: Hi, 

I'm upgrading a site to K2. I had the search plugin working quite nicely with a drop-down list for an extra query string  so the list enabled to search in either 'print' or 'digital' for the following folder set up:

Files
– Print
–– subfolder
––– subsubfolder
––– subsubfolder
–– subfolder
––– subsubfolder
––– subsubfolder
– Digital
–– subfolder
–––subsubfolder
–––subsubfolder
–– subfolder
––– subsubfolder
––– subsubfolder


I'm now trying out the new  $site->search(). 
To filter the search results by template doesn't help me much because all files use the same template.
I somehow need to filter by uid, which is giving me a serious headache. Any suggestions how to proceed?

Thanks!
