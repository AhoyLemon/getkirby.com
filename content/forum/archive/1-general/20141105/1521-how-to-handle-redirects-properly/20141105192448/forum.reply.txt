Text: For Kirby to Kirby transitions i.g. activating multi language support i just created a little test template and content site and printed:


```
  <?php foreach($pages->index() as $p): ?> 
  
Redirect /de/<?php echo $p->uri() ?> http://website.com/<?php echo $p->uri() ?><br>
 
 <?php endforeach ?>
```

Run the site and copy and paste the content into htaccess which works for now.
