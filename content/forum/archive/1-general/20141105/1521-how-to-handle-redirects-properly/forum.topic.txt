Text: I have been wondering how to handle redirects properly when moving sites, contents etc.

For example recently i decided to disable multi language support, so all urls obviously are not working anymore. No language code in the url anymore. So every site which is indexed by search engines result into the error site.

When transitioning from another script or site and moving to kirby the same case will be applied every link which is indexed will result in error pages.


So my question is, is it possible to target site redirects? 

For example having setting up something like

(just demonstration no real code here)

IF looking for site-content-123.ext REDIRECT to kirby/site-content-123
Obviously when moving sites, this needs to be setup for several site contents.

Any ideas?
