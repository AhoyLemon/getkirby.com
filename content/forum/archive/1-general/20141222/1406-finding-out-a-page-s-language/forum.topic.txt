Text: The revamped multi-language feature in Kirby 2 is working really nicely. However, I think there is an important bit of functionality missing. Currently it looks like there's no way of telling what language a particular bit of content is in.

This would be really useful when looping over a list of pages, where we only want to show the pages that are available/translated in the current language (as opposed to showing the fallback page in the default language). 

Without altering Kirby's core classes, I worked around this limitation by checking for the existence of the language code in the page's inventory:
 
```php
$currentLanguage = $site->language()->code;
foreach($articles as $article){
    $inventory = $article->inventory()['content']
    if( ! isset($inventory[$currentLanguage]) ){
        continue;
    }
   // ...
}
```

With a an additional `language` field on the page instance, this could be shortened to:

```php
foreach($articles->filterBy('language', 'en') as $article){
    // ...
}
```

This information is also important in other places, for example when setting the `lang` HTML attribute to make sure the browser applies correct hyphenation:

```php
echo '<div lang=" . $article->language() . ">...</div>"
```

Is this a known limitation or is there a simpler workaround for it?
