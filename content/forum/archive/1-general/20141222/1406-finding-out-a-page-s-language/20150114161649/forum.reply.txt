Text: Yeah I didn't really like the idea of adding a redundant language field to every file since that information is already contained in the file name.

Luckily, Bastian is [working on this issue](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/405b0d13a295e283cbf5da0f12e5869707402660) and when using the `develop` branch of Kirby it is now possible to call `$page->content()->language()`to get this information.
