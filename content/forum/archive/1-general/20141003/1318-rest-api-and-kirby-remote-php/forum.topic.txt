Text: I got to known that the kirby toolkit features functions to call and use external data via rest api. I have to say I am not an expert in api at all that's why I'd like to start this discussion so maybe everyone we can all help us each other :)

The remote script can be found here:
https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/blob/master/lib/remote.php

So my invoice script has an api which might be able to be called with this tool, working with curl and header requests. My problem is I have no clue how to use the remote script so far. There's no documentation as well as examples for it.

My script is using an api key, this would need to be incoperated.

Otherwise i guess it's pretty much standart having example.com/api/1/(call1)/(call2) etc. 

So i am interested to see, how it's genereally working so i can adjust it to my needs. Basically how to use it. echo variables which are called with api and whatsoever
