Text: Hi, i'm trying to launch a site that i've just finished working on - and I keep getting a blank page when I upload to the server. The site doesn't give any errors, just a blank page.

I've set the site up on another domain (different host) to test the .htaccess & config.php and it works fine. So it makes me think there's an issue with the host? - i've run phpinfo.php and it's running php5.4 on an Apache server.

As a test I also tried to upload the basic Kirby install, and got the same blank page.

Can anyone help me work out what I should be looking for to get this site working?

Thanks for your help.
