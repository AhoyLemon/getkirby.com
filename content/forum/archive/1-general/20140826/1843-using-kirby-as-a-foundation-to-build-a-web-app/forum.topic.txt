Text: I am considering using Kirby to create a business directory. I have tried it and really like the way it feels, especially the toolkit.

The way I see it, using Kirby for this project would mean:

- Creating a plugin to work with MongoDB or CouchDB (for the database that will hold the directory listings).
- Extending the panel with a few of screens to list, create, update and delete businesses.

(I think I'll use Kirby's pages with custom templates to present all content, including the business directory.)

With Kirby2 coming up and looking swell, I wonder what the way to develop a plugin will end up to be like and if extending the panel this way will be possible.

Or is it even now?...
