Text: Hi there,

Thanks for the reply.

Here's the contents of the current .htaccess file.


// # Kirby .htaccess



// # rewrite rules
// <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

// # enable awesome urls. i.e.:
// # http://yourdomain.com/about-us/team
// RewriteEngine on



// # make sure to set the RewriteBase correctly
// # if you are running the site in a subfolder.
// # Otherwise links or the entire site will break.
// #
// # If your homepage is http://yourdomain.com/mysite
// # Set the RewriteBase to:
// #
// # RewriteBase /mysite
// #
// RewriteBase /


// # block text files in the content folder from being accessed directly
// RewriteRule ^content/(.*)\.(txt|md|mdown)$ error [R=301,L]

// # block all files in the site folder from being accessed directly
// RewriteRule ^site/(.*) error [R=301,L]

// # block all files in the kirby folder from being accessed directly
// RewriteRule ^kirby/(.*) error [R=301,L]

// # make panel links work
// RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
// RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
// RewriteRule ^panel/(.*) panel/index.php [L]


// # make site links work
// RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
// RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
// RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]



// </IfModule>



// # Additional recommended values
// # Remove comments for those you want to use.
// #
// # AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
// #
// # php_flag short_open_tag on


The '//' don't exist in the .htaccess file, I just couldn't figure out how to write code on here without it appearing as an H1 heading. 


Now when I try and add a 301 redirect into this it can work depending on where I put it, but doesn't pull in any of the template files.

If I put it in after all of this then it works, but none of the links work and they all redirect back to the homepage.

Completely lost. 

These are the types of 301 redirects I'm trying to do. 

Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine on
rewritecond %{http_host} ^northeastcreative.com [nc]
rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://www.studionec.com/$1 [r=301,nc]
