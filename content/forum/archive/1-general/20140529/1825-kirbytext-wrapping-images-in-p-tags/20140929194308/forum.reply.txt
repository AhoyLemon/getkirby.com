Text: I have a similar situation here. 
Everything echoed via kirbytext comes wrapped in <p> tags. That is a bit of an issue as ideally I would like to add classes to different paragraphs
(say <p class=client> Name_of_Client</p>)
I have turned auto line breaks of in the config file but it does not affect the <p> tags, just the <br>.
I know I could switch to wrapping the <p></p> content inside divs but it does not seem good practice to over wrap elements. Besides, it would be good to be able to output two fields in the same line - credit + about this site + email for example.
Has anyone worked this around?

thanks
