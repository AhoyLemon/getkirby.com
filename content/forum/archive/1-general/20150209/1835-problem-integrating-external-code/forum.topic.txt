Text: So, I'm currently struggling with what should be the last two templates of my site and I figure now is the right time to ask around for opinions. Because of the amount of failed attempts at reaching my desired solution, I don't really have code to show, just explanations.

The template I'm currently trying to figure out (map.php) has to display a (link: http://leafletjs.com/ text:leaflet)-powered image (base concept is I have extra-high resolution digital paintings to display, and leaflet seems like the best way to achieve this without burning my server up every time the page it's loaded).

In this case, I'm trying to load a zoomify-created map into leaflet. Normally, such a map is created as: 
* A folder, containing folders containing folders (not sure how many layers and I think that depends on the map's size) that handles the image tile files. The folder also contains an xml file (ImageProperties.xml) which is used to tell leaflet the map's dimensions (for instance, the map I'm currently testing has "<IMAGE_PROPERTIES WIDTH='18391' HEIGHT='19996' NUMTILES='7617' NUMIMAGES='1' VERSION='1.8' TILESIZE='256' />" as its xml).
* A html file (which you can open to get to the rendered map, zoomable et all).
* Leaflet's css and js sheets.
* L.TileLayer.Zoomify.js, which is the script that handles the communication between zoomify and leaflet.
There's data about this whole process (link: http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2013/06/showing-zoomify-images-with-leaflet.html text: here).

I'm not sure how to use this in Kirby. So far, I've tried "dumbly" adapting code from the html file to fit it into a map.php template, putting the js and css files in the assets folder and putting the "main folder" (containing the map tiles) in the content folder as a child to the page supposed to display the map. That has not worked - at best, I have been able to create an empty-looking map. I am assuming Kirby is somehow interfering with what I'm trying to achieve, by protecting the "main folder" from direct access by L.TileLayer.Zoomify.js or otherwise rendering it impossible to summon.

I've also tried using an iframe as a last-ditch attempt (I've seen other pages displaying leaflet-powered maps doing it this way), but even that has failed for now.

Any hint? I've thought of putting the map folder in the assets folder, but this sounds incredibly brutal to me (and definitely doesn't look like what the assets folder is supposed to be used for) and I'm wondering whether I may be missing a simpler, less brutal method.

Desired result: I want pages designated as belonging to the map.php template to search for a map folder within their children (there will only ever be one folder there anyway) and to display it in a leaflet map.
