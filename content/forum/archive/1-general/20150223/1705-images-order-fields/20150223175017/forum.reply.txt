Text: If you haven't done it yet, first turn on debugging in your config file, in many cases this is helpful to find out what's going wrong. Sometimes if you don't see an error message, it might be hidden and you need to inspect the source code.

Then you would see the following error message: "Fatal error: Function name must be a string in ..."

Your error is in line 3 of your code above, there should be no parenthesis after $file:

```
  <?php echo $file->caption()->kirbytext() ?>
```
