Text: Hi,

Lovely looking theme at a great price. :)

However, I can't get the (link: http://kaunoskirby.aristotheme.com/ text: Kaunos theme demo)  to load in Firefox (Mac or PC). Everytime I've tried the result has been a blank page and 100%+ CPU usage. The only way I can get it to load in Firefox is to disable JavaScript first.

Unsure if it's a problem at my side or an issue with the theme.

Kind regards

John

EDIT: _Just downloaded the HTML version of Kaunos and it loads/works fine in Firefox.
Therefore it Looks like the issue may be related to the online Kirby demo only._
