Text: Yeah, looks like it. If I'm not mistaken, it seems that while there is an excerpt option in $defaults in feed.php, it doesn't seem to do anything with it. If you have a look at template.php in the feed plugin folder, you will find that the description field uses this piece of code:

```php
<description><![CDATA[<?php echo $item->{$textfield}()->kirbytext() ?>]]></description>
```

If you change that to 

```php
<description><![CDATA[<?php echo $item->{$textfield}()->excerpt(300) ?>]]></description>
```

you will get the excerpt. Although in that case it's probably better to add your own template in case of updates.
