Text: Hi all,

I'm trying to install kirby on my shared host provided by domainfactory. The startpage loads successfully without errors. As soon as I click on any local link I get an:

    Internal Server Error

    The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to        complete your request.

    Please contact the server administrator, [no address given] and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

    More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

    Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an     ErrorDocument to handle the request.


Im running Apache 2.2. and PHP 5.3. All permissions are set to 777 temporarily.

Any ideas what might cause this?

Thanx in advance, best Manuel
