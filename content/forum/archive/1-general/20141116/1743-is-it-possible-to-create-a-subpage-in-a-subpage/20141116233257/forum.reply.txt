Text: Sure. 

You just need to use the proper blueprint which allows having pages.

http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints

```
title: Page
pages: true
files: true
fields:
  title:
    label: Title
    type:  text
  text:
    label: Text
    type:  textarea
```

And even have functions to call them in your template.
