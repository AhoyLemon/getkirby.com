Text: All my current pages are accessed as if they were in a flat folder structure. For example:

```
http://adis.ca/post/creating-beaglebone-sd-image/
http://adis.ca/post/the-new-repeater-controller/
http://adis.ca/post/uino-1284p-arrived/
```

I also have the topic URL which lists all posts that fit a certain category. The creating-beaglebone-sd-image slug is filed under the Coding category. The following URL will list all the posts under coding:

```
http://adis.ca/topic/coding/
```

I understand I could create a flat folder structure which should automatically recreate my main method of accessing pages. For example:

```
content/post/1-creating-beaglebone-sd-image/post.txt
content/post/2-the-new-repeater-controller/post.txt
content/post/3-uino-1284p-arrived/post.txt
```

But how can I have the lists of various categories? I looked at routing, but it works based on children in the tree. So I could create a tree like folder structure and have a page listing all the posts under one category. That would recreate my /topic/ URL path. But that would change the final URL of all of my posts as they would not longer be under the /posts/ path, but under the /topic/ path.

I know I am missing something...
