Text: Hi,

I'd like to structure my page navigations based on topics. The idea is that all my pages would be in a tree like folder structure based on topics and sub topics. But at the same time I would like all pages to be available in a chronological list on a blog page and accessible via a http://<domain>/post/<title of page>.

How would I do this? I am thinking symlinking to each page might be a possibility. But is that really the proper or best or even possible way to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Adi
