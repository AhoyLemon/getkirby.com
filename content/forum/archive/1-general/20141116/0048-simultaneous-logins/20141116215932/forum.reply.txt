Text: Answering my second question from docs about panel:

"As you can see in the example above it is possible to set the panel option to true or false. By setting it to false you can create users, which can't login to the panel, but you can still provide a login and access for them to different parts of your website with the $user API.

This entirely replaces the auth plugin functionality from Kirby 1. All panel and site users can be administrated from the panel, which makes the new user system very powerful."
