Text: I had hoped/assumed that multiple users could be logged-in simultaneously (optionally) in Kirby using the same username/password. Most CMS systems permit this by some sort of 'switch'. Could someone tell me how to do this (if possible) or point me to docs that describe the limits of the user model?
