Text: I'm upgrading a client website to kirby 2 and this function, which was working with the previous version, now it throw out an error.
I tried to debug the code and apparently this is the only snippet of code which produces the error.

Here the code:

```
<?php 
$exhibitions = $pages->find('exhibitions')->visible()->children()->filterBy('now', 'noo');
$news = $pages->findBy('news')->visible()->children();
$homeflux = Pages::merge($exhibitions, $news);
?>
```

Does anybody know how to get the same result with the new kirby?


Thanks,
