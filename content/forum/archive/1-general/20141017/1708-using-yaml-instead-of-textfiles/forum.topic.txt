Text: I'm new to Kirby and i've used Jekyll so far and love its YAML based approach to Structured Content.

I saw that there is a YAML parser available inside Kirby wich makes my life with Kirby much easier. 

Is there a way to declare the layout directly with a YAML File or do i need an extra .txt File ?  For exemple:

Project-01
---media
---featured
---project-default.yml
Project-02
---media
---featured
---project-slider.yml
Project-03
---media
---featured
---project-default.yml

Thanks
