Text: Hi, this is a sort of general concern of mine, especially important when I hand the site over to a client. It's entirely probable that this is a result of my coding, but Kirby pages feel incredibly fragile to me. Say I have code in a page template like this:
```
<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg') ?>
<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"/>
```
If the name of that file is "1.jpg" instead of "01.jpg," or if it simply isn't present, the whole page fails to load, and returns a general error page.

This seems like overkill to me. Why not just return a broken image icon or something?

Any tips on preventing this from happening? (it seems to happen in a lot of contexts like this)
