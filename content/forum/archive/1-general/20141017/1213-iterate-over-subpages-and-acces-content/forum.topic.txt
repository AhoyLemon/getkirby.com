Text: I have several projects on my site. In each projectfolder i have some subfolder.

project-01
 --features
--media
--project.txt
project-02
--features
--media
--project.txt
etc

 I try to acces the content of each subfolder from a project and output it as a seperate section.

But it doesnt work. Whatâ€™s wrong with my method  ?
