Text: I want to add a right floated image to a page, but there mustn't be a page break before the succeeding text paragraph so that the images is placed within this paragraph. But this breaks the page layout and everything inside the article is wrapped in quotes and all the formatting is gone. If I add a page break before the text everything works fine (but the image isn't inside the paragraph anymore, so the spacing isn't right). It also works with left floated images.

Any clues?
