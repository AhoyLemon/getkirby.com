Text: Doesn't work. The problem isn't that there is no Markdown syntax, but that the Kirby panel automatically converts HTML special characters to its actual entity after you edit the article for at least one more time. Because, like said, if I enter "&AMPrsquo;" to an article, it gets converted to a right single quote (â€™). But I actually want to display the HTML code inside the article and not the "converted" entity. 

BTW, this also happens in forum here if I don't substitute the & with an & (have to write uppercase because else it gets converted).
