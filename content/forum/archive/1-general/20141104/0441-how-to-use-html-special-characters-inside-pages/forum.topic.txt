Text: I want to se HTL special characters inside my pages, for example like "–", but they should get converted it the actual entity but remain "as is". 

Because for example, when i write "&amp;amp;" it gets converted to "–" when I save the page. But I really want to depicture the HTML code and not the result of the HTML code.  

Any clues?
