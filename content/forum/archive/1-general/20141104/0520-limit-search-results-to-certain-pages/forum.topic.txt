Text: Within my panel I have different categories, one called "Articles" for the main articles of my blog and one for "About" for the about page of my blog. However when I use the search plugin, I only want to search for Articles, and not for About pages. 

Any clue how to limit that? 

Tried `->filterBy('articles')`, but then I get no search results at all.
