Text: Hey guys, I'm really interested in migrating my 15+ year old blog from Wordpress over to Kirby. The biggest concern for me is I've spent years organizing each post into Categories and Tags.

From the documentation, it looks like Kirby has built-in support for Tags but there's no support for Categories.

So instead, I'm wondering if I could create a separate set of tags that I could use as Categories.

Is this possible?
