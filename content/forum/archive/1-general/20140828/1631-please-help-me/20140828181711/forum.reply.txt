Text: `->children()->children()` will get all grandchildren in one list, so that's not what you want. I'm not entirely sure what it is you're wanting to do.

If you want to show children of children and have them split up, you'll have to do as @sashtown suggests and have a loop within a loop. Loop through children of the projects page (which is the projects) and then loop through children of those.

If you're trying to just display the children of the first project, I think you could do something like this (assuming you always want the first project, and not a specific project):

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->visible()->first()->children()->visible() AS $sub): ?>
content
<?php endforeach ?>
```

If you want a specific project instead of the first one, you could use `find()` or `findByUID` to get the specific page.
