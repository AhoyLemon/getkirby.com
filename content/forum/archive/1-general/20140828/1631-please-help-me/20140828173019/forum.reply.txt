Text: I'm not sure if I got your issue correctly but you cannot use the snippet for the projects page to fetch the children of its subpage.

Let's say you have a `kategori.php` template you'd have to address the level below:

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->visible() as $sub): ?>
[...]
<?php endforeach ?>
```

Hope that helps.
