Text: it always depends on your knowledge ...

if there is some experience with the usual php then working with the docs and cheatsheet can already get most of the things done very easily. Even with only basic php knowledge using all sorts of calls with foreach, "find", "visible",  conditions, and all those things which can be found in the docs really easy.

so i can recommend: 

if your php in general is not the greatest, you can start with any book, or even online tutorial. there's lots of informations to be found on the interwebs. if you were to have some knowledge already, you are always free to ask in the forums if there's anything you don't understand.
