Text: Hi there!

I am loving Kirby! That's the main issue here I guess :P  I am really a PHP beginner and want to learn more about it,  so I can use Kirby with more independency from others. 

I have no idea where to start, meaning what course or book can I buy to learn the fastest (and also the right) way about the Kirby structure and be able to wright my own bits of code for example tag filtering, search options, or a function to show specific bits of content etc.

Hope to hear from u guys!
