Text: I'm also having this same problem. Is this config option not available in Kirby 2?

I need to force the site URL because my shared hosting provider prepends "www" to the servername when creating vhosts. This means the base URL coming from Kirby's auto detection is wrong/different to my host name

Example:

My host name is blog.example.com but Kirby's base URL is www.blog.example.com. I could just add this host name an extra DNS entry but I'd rather keep everything clean and tidy.
