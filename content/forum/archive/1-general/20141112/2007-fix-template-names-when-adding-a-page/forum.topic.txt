Text: Hi everyone,
I have a little problem with the selection of template with the dropdown menu.

Inside my Projects folder you can choose to add a page with a 'project' or 'showcase' template. I edited my blueprint like this
```
title: Projects
pages:
  template: 
	  - project
	  - showcase
```
but then inside the panel this is what I get.

The selection works, and when I add the page it loads the correct blueprint but the names are wrong. How can I fix it?

Thank you!
