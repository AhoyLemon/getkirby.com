Text: Im looping over some projects. In each project-folder there is a featured.png.
Because im working on a modular theme for Kirby i try to pass a variable to a snippet called m-projects.php where i try to output that featured image. But i doesnt work.

Part of my Template Code:

and the snippet i do include:

(gist: https://gist.github.com/danielschmid/8eb5668f06b1f54996c8)

But nothing happens and the images exists. Is there any problem how i'm passing over my $data to the snippet ?

 Any ideas ?
