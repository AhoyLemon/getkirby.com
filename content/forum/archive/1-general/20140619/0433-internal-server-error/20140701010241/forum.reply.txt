Text: fixed it!
for anyone searching, you have to change options in the apache httpd.conf file:

uncomment this line:
		LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

change: 
		'AllowOverride None' to 'AllowOverride All'

IMPORTANT!:
under your directory, add an entry for the EXACT folder you placed kirby in (or you can use your/directory/*). this is where I had issues

	<Directory /your/directory/here/* >
	    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
	    AllowOverride All
	    Order allow,deny
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>

and it should work! MAMP's httpd.conf must have this set by default
