Text: Yeah I tried that, and the XAMPP tutorial as well. That's how I figured out I was missing the .htaccess file, but re-adding it ended up breaking the site more than it already was. 

I uploaded it to a domain I barely use, and it works fine there so I must have the correct files. The problem with that is it takes ~1/2 hour to update the site. Maybe there's a bug? or Kirby uses newer php? I can't think of any other reason it would work on MAMP and not regular apache
