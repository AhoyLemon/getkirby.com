Text: I'm in the process of trying out kirby, using osx's built in apache server. However when I navigate to the page (after copying all the files) the browser returns 

"Internal Server Error:
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, you@example.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

I've tried turning off rewrite in config.php, editing .htaccess, putting it in and out of subfolders, etc. and I still can't get it to work. If I remove .htaccess however, the index page displays but none of the links work, so I'm pretty sure .htaccess is at fault here, but I'm not sure how? Any ideas?
For the record I've been testing Stacey and static html5 pages as well on this server, and they've all worked perfectly
