Text: I have used structured fields for this purpose in the past, in the panel that would be sth like:

```php
fields:
      media:
        label: Media Item
        type: text
      caption:
        label: caption
        type: text
```

and then in the fields, you would then put image tags or vimeo tags.

The only downside is that you can't drag and drop images into the modal window
