Thanks for your suggestion!

I think I tried that before (at least, I tried many forms for the $image thing - honestly I think your syntax is closer to the right one, assuming there is a right one for my scenario). 

Either way, just double-checked and unfortunately it doesn't work (same crash as "usual"). This is looking more and more like an actual bug and not just a syntax error from my perspective.

*wonders whether updating the core to latest version might correct this*
