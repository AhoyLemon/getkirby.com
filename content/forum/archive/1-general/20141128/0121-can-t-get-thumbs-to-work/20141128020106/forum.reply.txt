Text: Ah, sorry, indeed it's not clear as is.

If I include the code as-is, the page loads and lands on a "site is down" status page (seems to be standard when there's an error in the php code, but despite re-reading my code dozens of times I can't seem to locate said error this one time and I assume it's actually a problem with Thumbs).

If there are new images in the gallery, the page will first spend time "loading" (generating the thumbnails in the thumbs folder) and then land on the status page; if there are no new images, it goes straight to the status page (I assume it checks the thumbs folder and doesn't want to renew thumbnails, and the check is infinitely quicker than the generation?).

The thumbnails appear to generate well enough (right now, I'm working on MAMP precisely because I wanna prepare the whole gallery, thumbnails included, before I upload the thing). I will try and check the memory_limit tomorrow, and share it here.

The problem (probably) is twofold: I need to be able to use the thumb function without crashing Kirby, and I need to be able to effectively use the thumbs it creates (most probably in an <img> html tag in order to be able to use the custom class I made for gallery thumbnails).
