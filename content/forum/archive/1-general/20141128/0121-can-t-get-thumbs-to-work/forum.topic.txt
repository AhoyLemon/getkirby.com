<ul class="gallery">
  <?php foreach($gallery->images()->sortBy('date', 'desc')->limit(4) as $image): ?>
    <li>
      <a title="<?php echo $image->caption() ?>" rel="gallery" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>">

        <img src="<?php echo thumb($image->image(), array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true), false) ?>" class="fancythumb" />	
                        
      </a>
    </li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>

Sooo yeah, I've spent the afternoon trying to figure this out and I'm not getting it.
What I'm trying to do is a FancyBox gallery (display thumbnails that, upon clicking, open the image as a pop-up instead of a new page).

The gallery works, granted I use css to reduce the size of the original image files instead of thumbs. I am susceptible to use pretty huge image files, so this is a big problem.

Whenever I try to use thumb, it fails. Worst / best part being, it fails, but it does create the thumbnails in my thumbs folder.

Running Kirby 2.0.

Any hint?
