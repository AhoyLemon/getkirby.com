Text: Can you elaborate on 'it fails' ? Does the plugin fails for every thumbnail or just some ?

The thumb plugins tends to fail depending on the available memory on your server, the less memory, the less it can handle huge files.

To know how much memory is allocated to php and its plugins (thumbs uses the GD module or the Imagick Module) create a php file on your server, say for example `phpinfo.php`with the following content:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

and visit it in your browser, look for the field `memory_limit`.

If this is the issue, there are ways to allocate more memory, or just switch to another plan on your host, otherwise, you 'll have to manually (or programmaticaly, using tools like **image magick convert**) downsize your images.
