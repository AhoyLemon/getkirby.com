Text: So, did a little more testing.

The Thumb function will crash if there is even a single image to thumb (even if the thumb already exists).

(( "Error

This site is currently not available. Please try again in a couple minutes or contact the administrator." ))

My memory_limit is apparently set at 128M. But considering the way the function crashes I honestly doubt it's the problem (else, I'd expect it to be able to work with at least one image).

Also of note: I'm not using the plugin, actually (if I try and put the Thumb.php plugin in my plugin folder, it crashes the whole site). I've gathered that Plugin has been added to Kirby 2.0, and am trying to use that. It does manage to create thumbnails well (even though it simultaneously crashes the pages where it's called), so I'm assuming I'm just badly using it (documentation seems lacking, too).

The function will create thumbs for the images it finds, but I can't use it and not crash the page when I try to use the resulting thumbs. I'm stuck for now.
