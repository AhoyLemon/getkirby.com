Text: When the client inserts an image on a specific page, and renames the image. I get the following error.
Somehow, when the image gets renamed, kirby creates a file named: image-name.jpg.txt

When this file is empty, the site gives this error:

```
Notice: Uninitialized string offset: 0 in C:wampwwwpath-to-sitekirbylibvariables.php on line 27
```

I'm running the site on a demo server. 

Any help?
