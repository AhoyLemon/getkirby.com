Text: I agree that Kirby would be a good solution for your purpose. I just don't see why you would want to have a static part plus a CMS when you could generate both the static and dynamic pages via Kirby (while using an HTML template as a basis for your Kirby templates).

As regards the carousel part, yes, you can easily fetch those uploaded images in your template and build a carousel from them.

Plus, while you need some basic PHP to create your templates, it's pretty easy to set up with the help of the docs.
