Text: I'd appreciate some advice please. I've got experience of static pages/html5/css but now I've been asked to build a website for a local school. 

The majority of site will consist of static pages. No problem.
 
The individual class pages will need teachers to regularly add content - text/images....I'd like to keep this process as simple as possible - the most intuitive, logical interface
 
I was intending to use a  responsive HTML template for this project making key sections of class pages integrated with light cms package to allow teachers to upload..

Also is it straightforward to stipulate certain design  via CMS - i.e. uploaded images go into carousel-style image display?

Would Kirby be appropriate for this kind of project?
 
Many thanks in advance!
