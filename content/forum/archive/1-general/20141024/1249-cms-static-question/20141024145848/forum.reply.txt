Text: I guess kirby would fit perfectly. I suggest to have a try and download the starterkit from github. If you don't know how to run a web server on your local computer i'd point you to MAMP or if you are on a mac i can write you a short tutorial on how to set up apache. 

The if you succeed there's plenty of documentation to read which is easy to understand. Since kirby has a relatively easy and straight forward way of doing things you'll learn a bit php on the way to.

Let me know if you have any more questions.
