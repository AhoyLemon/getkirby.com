Text: A path to maybe look into: 

In your project, make your "invisible" image have a name such as "0000-projectthumb.jpg", and give every other image a name preffixed with a number (for instance, "01-blabla.jpg"). In your projects list page template (the one with the project thumbnails), do

```
<?php foreach ($projects as $project): ?>
 <a href="<?php echo $project->url() ?>">
<img src="<?php echo thumb($project->image("projectthumb.jpg"), array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true), false) ?>">
</a>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

(It will also work if you use $project->images()->first() and name your project thumb with the first name in alphabetical ordering within the project folder.)

In your project page template, do

```
<?php $counter = 0 ?>
<?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
<?php if($counter != 0): ?>
<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" >
<?php endif ?>
<?php $counter = $counter +1 ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

Point is, the $counter variable will exclude the first image from being displayed.
Hope that helps.
