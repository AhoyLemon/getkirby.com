Text: Maybe I'm mistaken, but I'm even not sure this function exists, it's not in files.php and it never seemed to work for me.

There is `findByExtension()` and `findByType()`, however.

Instead, you can use `filterBy($key,$value)`with some keys like:

- filename
- name
- size
- type
- modified

and you can of course also filter by any meta information you have added to the files (i.e. in the text files for each file).
