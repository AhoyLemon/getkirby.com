So my scenario here goes something like this (sorry for possible bad english):

I have a bunch of buttons that open modal windows. And those modal windows have a content from pages i have made just for that purpose, and at the moment it kinda works with Ajax quite well. But im wondering if there could be better way to do it. 

So at the moment my buttons have data-url="/content-folder/content" that is added to my ajax, wich has the url front part, lets say its just localhost:8888/project, so when i click the button it adds the data-url to end of that so it will be like this now: 
localhost:8888/project/content-folder/content, and it adds that content to a <div> that is in the modal. 

While this kinda works, the problem here is that it loads the whole page with headers and everything, i had to create own header for it so it wont load multiple jQuery's to mess up the page. 

So basically my question here is, is there a simplier way to do this? 
Something like getting just the content from the page, without headers and everything. 

I can try to setup a demo if anything is unclear, i hope you understood :)
