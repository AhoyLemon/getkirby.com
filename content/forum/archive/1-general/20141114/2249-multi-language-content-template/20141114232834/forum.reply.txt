Text: As far as I'm aware, this doesn't work, but as a workaround you could put the language specific parts of your template (or the complete templates) into snippets and call the snippets in the main template depending on site language, something like:

```php
<?php if ($site->language()->code() = "fr") {
    snippet('home_fr"); }
    else {
    snippet('home_en');
}
?>
```
