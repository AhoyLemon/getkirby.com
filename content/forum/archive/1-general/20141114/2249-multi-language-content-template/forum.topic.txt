Text: Hi guys, 

I'm working on my new version of my blog with the V2 of Kirby. 
I'm implementing 2 languages, ok content files like these are working well : 
   - site.fr.txt
   - site.en.tkt
But is it possible to create a special template for each language ? 
   - menu.fr.txt  ->  menu.fr.php
   - menu.en.txt  ->  menu.en.php 
I tried but nothing appened... :/ 
Anyone could help me with this issue ? 

Thanks in advance guys !
