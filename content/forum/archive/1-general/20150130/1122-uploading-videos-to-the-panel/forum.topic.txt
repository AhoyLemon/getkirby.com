Text: Hey guys,

I just figured out that the panel seems to disallow video uploads. Every time I try it returns the message "File not found".  Doesn't matter which type of video, mp4/webm/m4v, all are declined. Has anyone an idea how to solve this? It's a client's project, so it has to work, no matter how… the old panel config where you could set the allowed files for uploading isn't working anymore, and I can't find another option to go with…

Thanks guys!
