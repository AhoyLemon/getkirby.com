Text: With the `inventory()` method of the `$page` object you will have access to all "inventory" of a page. `$page->inventory()` will return an array of arrays, one of them is 'content', which has key/value pairs of language code and filename if the file exists.

So, when I have a page home.de.txt, and home.en.txt and home.fr.txt exists as well, `$page->inventory()` will output:

    Array
    (
        [children] => Array
            (
            )
        [content] => Array
            (
                [de] => home.de.txt
                [en] => home.en.txt
                [fr] => home.fr.txt
            )
        [meta] => Array
            (
            )
        [thumbs] => Array
            (
            )
        [files] => Array
            (
            )
    )
