Text: In Kirby 1, I used the following code for my language switch:

    <?php 
        $langs=c::get('lang.available');
        $current=c::get('lang.current');
    ?> 
    <nav class="language-switch">
	<?php foreach($langs as $lang):?>
                    <?php if($page->content($lang) != false):?> 
                           <?php if($lang!==$current):?>
                                  <span>
                                         <a href="<?php echo $page->url($lang)?>"><?php echo $lang?></a> 
                                 </span> 
                        <?php endif?> 
                 <?php endif?> 
           <?php endforeach?>
    </nav>

The idea was to show the language switch only if content in the respective other language was available.

In Kirby 2, this code doesn't work anymore.

For Kirby 2 I have adapted the code according to the docs:

    <nav class="languages" role="navigation'"> 
	<?php foreach($site->languages() as $language): ?>
		<?php if(($site->language() !== $language)): ?>
			<span>
				<a href="<?php echo $page->url($language->code()) ?>"><?php echo html($language->code()) ?></a> 
			</span> 
		<?php endif ?>
	<?php endforeach?>
    </nav>

While this works, I don't get the content part to work, i.e. the condition "if the content is available in the other language, than do show the language option" or maybe "if the content is not available then link to the start page".

So, basically, my question is: how can I check if content is available in a specific language?

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.
