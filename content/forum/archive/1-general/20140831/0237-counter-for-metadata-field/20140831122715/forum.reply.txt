Text: Hey thanks for your fast reply but it doesn't work on my page. I have added the following code:

   $articles = $pages->find('einsaetze')->children->invisible();
   foreach ($articles as $article) {
        $vehicle = (string)$article->vehicles();
        $numberOfVehicles = $articles->filterBy('vehicles', $vehicle)->count();
        //stuff you want to do here  
        echo $numberOfVehicles;
     }

Here my folder structure:
Einsaetze -> 02-grossbrand -> einsatz-eintrag.txt // This is like a blog 
Technik -> LÃ¶schgruppenfahrzeug -> fahrzeuge.txt // Here i will have the number

On the Page "Einsaetze -> 02-grossbrand -> einsatz-eintrag.txt" i have added the following line:

Vehicles: lf-2016

Thanks
