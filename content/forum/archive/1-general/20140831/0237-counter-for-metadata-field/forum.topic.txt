Text: Hi guys, there is a possibility can output the number of a metadata field? So I have for example a page (similar blog) on the subpages there is a field "vehicles". Now I would make a separate page for each vehicle. Then on the (Blog) page I want the number of each vehicle how often it occurs in all posts. Is this possible without a database?

Thanks for your Help
