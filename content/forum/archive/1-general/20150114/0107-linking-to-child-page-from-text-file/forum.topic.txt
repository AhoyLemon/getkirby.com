I have a page that has a sub nav for child pages that I'll load into a single wrapper with history.pushState. I want the first option to load when you click the menu item for 'Projects' — I’ve managed to route to the child using the following:

c::set('routes', array(
  array(
    'pattern' => 'projects',
    'action'  => function() {
      return page('projects/in-progress');
      }
    )
  ));

but what that does is load the content of that page with the base url still — mysite.com/projects. What I want to do is have the page load with mysite.com/projects/in-progress. 

In the last version of Kirby you could do this easily by adding  link.txt to the parent folder and using Link: 'projects/in-progress' — but that doesn't seem to work anymore.

Any suggestions?
