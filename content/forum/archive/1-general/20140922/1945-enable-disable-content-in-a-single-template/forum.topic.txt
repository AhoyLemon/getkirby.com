Text: Hi,

I wonder if I can enable or disable single elements on my page in the panel. I have a template with a info-container, which shall be displayed in some cases and in others not. 

First I considered to apply a second template and a second Blueprint, but it can happen that more information can be added later and I want to prevent a template change. Does Kirby have a solution for this? 

Thank you!
