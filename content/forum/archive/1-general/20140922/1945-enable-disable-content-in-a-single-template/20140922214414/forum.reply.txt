Text: This is OK as long as "infocontainer" is the name of the field and "on" is the word from the text file corresponding to infocontainer field.

    <?php if($page->infocontainer() == 1): ?> 
    infoconatiner code
    <?php endif ?>

Like this:
   
    title: Title
    ----
    ...
    ----
    infocontainer: 1

And the blueprint for infocontainer:

    infocontainer:
      label: Infocontainer
      type: checkbox
      text: Show infocontainer?
