Text: I'm trying to implement the Off Canvas from the latest foundation. Somehow the only element that will slide is my header. 

I'm using snippets for the header and footer, the Off Canvas doesn't seem to understand this.

Has anyone succesfully used an Off Canvas menu? The one from foundation, or another wich will work?
