Text: Hi there,

After a long time, I finally found the time to build my personal website with Kirby. I'm primarily a designer and don't have much PHP experience. I do have HTML/CSS experience, though. So, please bear with me.

I designed a simple blog index page that lists all my postings. I have 2 different post types; an article and a link (sort of like Daring Fireball). Since I tend to post quite a lot, I want to display them by hour. So, at the top you see the current date and then every post in that day ordered by time.

You can see a screenshot here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44703/Notebook.png

Can anyone help me to accomplish this with Kirby? 

Any help is much appreciated, so thank you in advance!
