Text: There's a little known kirby function that lets you combine content from multiple locations. Then you can use sorting just like on a normal kirby object. `Pages::merge`

Here's my example. So you can see I'm getting the children of two different paths, then merging them into one variable. Then farther down I can sort that by date and do a foreach loop as if it was any normal set of pages.

```php
<?php
    $resourcebase = $pages->find('developers/resources')->children();
    $videos = $pages->find('developers/videos')->children();
    $resourcemerge = Pages::merge($resourcebase, $videos);
?>
```
