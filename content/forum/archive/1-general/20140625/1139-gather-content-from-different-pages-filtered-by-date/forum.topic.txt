Text: Hello,
I followed the tutorial for [a one pager](http://getkirby.com/blog/one-pager). Everything is working fine.

I'd need to display all these different content not as separate sections, but as single entries and then to order them all by date (from last to first, I could use the flip() command).
In short, I'm asking if it is possible to replicate the structure of a classic blog without duplicating content, but by simply echoing it from other folders and creating in this way a blog in the home page.

A possible way that came up to my mind was to filter all the page while it is uploading the content, using isotope.js and setting a date value with kirby. But that isn't the best way I think.

Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Andr√©
