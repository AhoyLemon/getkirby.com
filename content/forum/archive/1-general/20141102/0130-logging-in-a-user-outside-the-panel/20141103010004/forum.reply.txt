Text: The current user role is available here: 

   $role =  $site->user()->role(); 

Can be used to show / hide part of the site depending on the role. 

To use the panel form for login, redirect to `/panel` instead of `/login`. 

To make a separate login page : http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/user/login

Problem with this solution is that the user is redirected and loose track of the URL. How to keep him on the page, hide the content and show a login form only when he is not logged in ? 
I made another topic with this question: http://getkirby.com/forum/general/20141103/front-end-authentification-global-firewall
