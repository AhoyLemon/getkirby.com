Text: Sorry, don't mean to push, but this is very important to my first Kirby site. I'm doing my best to master PHP, per Bastian's intriguing arguments re: templating, etc, but I'm a PHP novice. I hoped to use an excellent external script, but its vendor has been unable to decipher its interactions with Kirby and that isn't working for me either.

To try to be clearer:

1. Is it possible yet to register a user in the panel and set access/no-access to them for 'x' public pages in the website? (I know they can be assigned a role that displays/blocks the panel itself ... separate subject).

2. Can someone share a code snippet or full example (awesome) that explains where one would insert login code within a Kirby template to make this work?

I am studying/experimenting with the user api, but no joy.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing/able to help!

.... and, yeah, Kirby is the "it". I am still trying to understand why I am having flat-out fun with a CMS for the first time in many years ....
