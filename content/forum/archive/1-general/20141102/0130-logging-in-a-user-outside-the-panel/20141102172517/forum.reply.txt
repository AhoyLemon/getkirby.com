Text: I haven't updated my Kirby 1 login stuff to Kirby 2 yet, so I can only partly help, but I try with a starting point:

1. set up a new user role in config.php like described (link:http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/roles text: here), that is,  copy the complete snippet from that page into your config file

2. You will then have a new user role in the panel, i.e. client with no panel access.

3. In every template you want to restrict, put this piece of code:

    ```php
        <?php if(empty($site->user())){
        go('/login');
        } ?>
    ```
    This directs a user who is not yet logged in to the login page.

4. Now you need to create a login and a logout page in /content.

5. Setup your form on the login page (I haven't done that yet, so maybe someone else can help you here)

I don't think you can restrict different parts of the site to different users, although that might even be possible by defining different user roles ... who knows?

Hope this helps for a start ... Maybe it's even possible to use the panel login form for that or use it as a starting point anyway.
