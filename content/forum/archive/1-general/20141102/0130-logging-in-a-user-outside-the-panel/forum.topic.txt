Text: Could someone post code to show login code for a registered user but that bypasses the panel, while giving that same user access to part of a public Kirby site ? If I understand the docs, the user api supports this, but I can't figure out how to do it.

Or, if this isn't supported yet, could someone confirm that for me?

(edited: for instance, this: "With Kirby 2's new user roles it is possible to create frontend users, who have access to certain locked parts of your website (such as a client download area) but are not allowed to login to the panel to make changes to the website."

Do I tell a Kirby template to give access to everyone who has 'x' role? If so, how?)
