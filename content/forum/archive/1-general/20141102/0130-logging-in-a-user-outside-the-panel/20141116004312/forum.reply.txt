Text: I was (am) thankful for your replies.  I could not get:

    <?php if(empty($site->user ...

to work but I succeeded with 

    <?php if(!$site->user()) {
        go('login');
        }  ?>

Then, as well as redirecting upon login, I displayed a different navigational scheme for logged-in users:

    <?php if(!$site->user()) {
        $navbarName = 'navbar' ; 
        } else {
        $navbarName = 'navbar-portal';
         }  ?>

I should make clear that  login was not forced for every page, otherwise these two code fragments would collide. Login is invited as a menu entry in 'navbar'. So, most pages happily display either of the two navbars depending on login status.

I have not yet experimented with roles.
