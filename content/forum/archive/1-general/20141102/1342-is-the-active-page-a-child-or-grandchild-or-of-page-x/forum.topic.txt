Text: Hello,

I have the following structure:

Folder
- SubFolder1
--SubSubFolder1
---SubSubSubFolder1
--SubSubFolder2
- SubFolder2

I want to know, if *SubSubSubFolder1* or *SubSubFolder2* is a somehow a child of *Folder*.

As I understand **isChildOf('Folder')** checks only for direct childs?

Can anyone help me?

Cheers,
Jan
