Text: You can setup to make the sitemap crawl all sites, all images, all custom fields and everything else...

I adjusted mine in the tutorial there were several things i wanted to change.

Like sitemap images and video.

with the pages->index() command it's actually getting all pages, children and grandchildren.

If i were to give an advise don't forget to add ->visible() because you may have unfinished and private pages which shouldn't get indexed.....

->visible() also only includes pages which are visible ( which is your problem @ti_gr 

It's really a matter of fact what is needed and the very basic tools given by kirby can the very best sitemap which couldn't be better compared to wordpress plugins or other sitemap generators.

Cheers.
