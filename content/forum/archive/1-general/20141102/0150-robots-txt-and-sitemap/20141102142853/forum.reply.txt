Text: @carstengrimm Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for.
But it's only working with parent-sites, right? Is there a solution to ignore all invisible pages (parents and childrens)? Or is there only the workaround with an extra "show or hide in sitemap" checkbox in every blueprint? 

Would be awesome to have it fully automatic.
