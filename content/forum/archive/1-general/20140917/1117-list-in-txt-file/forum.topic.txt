Text: I'm new to kirby, and kind of php aswell. Im trying to create a list in my content. I have a blog post with a Title, Subtitle and some Text. 

Is it possible to add some kind of List, if so, how?

I tried some Foreach loops but none of them seem to get the result I need. To be clear, it's not a Menu or something, it really is an list of items.
