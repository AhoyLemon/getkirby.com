Text: Hi,

I'm not quite sure I understand what you are trying to do.

If you just want a list in your content text file, you can simply use Markdown syntax, i.e. use asterisks, pluses or hyphens for unordered lists or numbers for ordered lists, see (link: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#list).

If you want to create a list from yaml-content or whatever in your templates, you would use a foreach-loop in your template file.
