Text: Hi,
I don't know how can resolve this with Kirby but if you use Apache you can use mod_rewrite.
For this you need a htaccess-file and you have to set RewriteEngine on and declare a rewrite rule.
RewriteRule ^/en/company$ /company [R=301,L]

I don't know if this works well but this is the way which can help you.
