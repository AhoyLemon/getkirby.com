Text: I'm working on a project that has a sidebar that changes frequently and needed to be updated by the client.  I'm not sure how to implement this using Kirby.   If I make the sidebar a snippet, then it's code not content.  If I include the sidebar in each page, then the user would have to update the sidebar in each page.  How to I implement this?
