Text: Hi everybody!

Is there a way to get all the pages from 2 different categories or sections? Something like that?

 <?php foreach(page('projects')->children()->visible() as $project || page('blog')->children()->visible() as $news): ?>

I want to show in a page all the projects resume and some news between them.

Is it posible?

Thank you very much!
