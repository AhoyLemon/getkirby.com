Text: A basic approach could be something like this:

```php
<?php
$alphas = range('A', 'Z');
$clients = $page->clients()->split('-');
sort($clients);

foreach($alphas as $alpha) {
	$i = 0;
	foreach($clients as $client) {
		if(substr($client, 0,strlen($alpha)) == $alpha) {
			if($i == 0) {
				echo $alpha;
			}
			echo $client; $i++;
		}
	}	
}
?>
```
However, the code above should be adjusted to leave out the headline and it doesn't work if the client's names contain hyphens. Instead, you could use split() on the parsed markdown, using the li tags as separator. Or, instead of using the list syntax, just separate the clients names by commas.

In any case, I think it would be easier to use a YAML list of clients, which leaves you with an associative array which you can loop through.
