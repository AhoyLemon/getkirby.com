Text: Although that last one, you're getting the children of the current page, so `without($page->uid())` will never exclude anything. You're probably actually wanting to do pull from the same set (everything under 'column') instead of the children of the current page, which could explain why you're not getting the results you expect.

You may actually want to be returning siblings of the current page instead of children:

```php
<?php $articles = $page->siblings()->visible()->flip()->without($page->uid())->limit(3); ?>
```
