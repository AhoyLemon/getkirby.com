Text: Easy way: `<?php $article = $pages->find('column')->children()->visible()->without($page->uid())->last(); ?>`

Notice the `->without($page->uid())` bit. That takes the uid (basically the slug) of the current page and feeds it to the without function to exclude it from the list of returned pages. So basically that line of code should return the last child under "column" that's not the current page.
