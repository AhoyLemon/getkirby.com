Text: So I can't wrap my head around this logic at the moment. I'm trying to exclude data depending on the page I am viewing.

For example (see <a href="http://cl.ly/Wbex/Chris%20Burton%20-%20Pre-Law.png">screenshot</a>)

Read the title of the article. Now, look at the subfooter of the list of receding articles. How can I get rid of article I am currently viewing (see 6)?

I want this functionality to be the same no matter what article I'm viewing. For instance, if I am viewing Kirby Comments, I don't want that to show up in the subfooter.

To get the last article's content on the homepage, this is my code:

    <?php $article = $pages->find('column')->children()->visible()->last();

    <article>
        <?php echo markdown($article->textarea()); ?>
    </article>

For the subfooter, I am doing this:

    <?php
        $articles = $page->children()->visible()->flip()->paginate(3);
        foreach($articles as $article): 
    ?>

    <article class="article">
        <span class="numeral"><?php echo ltrim($article->num(), '0'); ?></span>
        <span><a href="<?php echo html($article->url()) ?>"><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></a></span>
        <time pubdate="pubdate"><?php echo $article->date('n·j·Y'); ?></time>
    </article>

    <?php endforeach; ?>
