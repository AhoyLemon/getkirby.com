Text: @texnixe Hey, thanks for helping. For some reason that does not have any effect.

**Edit**: Correction, it is not working on the homepage however, it is working on single article pages. The problem with the code above is that it doesn't output anything. It should output 3 articles but exclude the current page article from being within that list.
