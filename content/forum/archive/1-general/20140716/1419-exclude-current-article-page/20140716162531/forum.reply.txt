Text: And for the second bit, you can do this:

```php
    <?php $articles = $page->children()->visible()->flip()->without($page->uid())->limit(3); ?>
```

At least I assume from your screenshot that you're not actually paginating those, so I'd use limit instead of paginate. Then you don't need the conditional statement to drop the current page.

Side note: the method of using a conditional statement in the foreach loop to drop the current page would mean that if the current page is one of the items returned when you're filling your $articles variable, you would only have two items left in the loop. And if it wasn't one of the items, you would have three. So using `without()` before the limit should give you three items every time.
