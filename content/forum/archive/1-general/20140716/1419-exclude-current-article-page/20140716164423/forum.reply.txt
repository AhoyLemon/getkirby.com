Text: @fitzage Ah ha! `->siblings()` in fact worked but only if I'm on a single article page. It does not work on the homepage where I am listing the latest article.

The homepage outputs the Work page as it is a sibling to that.


So perhaps I could use an if-statement to use `->children()` on the homepage and `->siblings()` on the child pages?
