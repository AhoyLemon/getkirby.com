Text: $gallery->images() will return a set of images, therefore $gallery->images->url() does not work. If you want to get the URLs for all images, you will have to use another foreach loop after the first one:

    <? foreach ($gallery->images() as $image) ?>
        <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" />
    <? endforeach ?>
