Text: Hi,
without any code or take a view on the website it is like a view in a christalbowl.
For this I can imaging a lot of possible variations.

For using css files you can use at Kirby 
   echo css('assets/css/main.css');
it will use link-element automatically.

Because I'm often work with Java-Developer and create for them HTML-Userinterfaces I given up to use ID's.  Because some Software create ID's and they could change.
Every you could do with ID's you could also do with classes :).
