Text: `div:nth-child(2)`only makes sense if you want every 2nd div-container to have the same color, if you want different colors like in the "markhadley" example, you want to give each container a different class or id and then define a separate color for each of these classes.

Make sure that your body has no padding or border if you want the divs to be 100% of the browser window, the original starterkit css has some padding and margin on the body.
