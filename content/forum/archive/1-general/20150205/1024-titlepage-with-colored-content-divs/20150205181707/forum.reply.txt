Yeah, I agree. Without much information it's hard to tell what needs to happen. The more info we can get in these posts the easier it is to come up with helpful ideas.

I'm glad you mentioned the Kirby way to link to a CSS file. I made the assumption that @thinkitsimple was still learning in my response so I tried to keep it basic.

Regarding the use of ID's: I'm with you, I rarely use ID's these days because I work on bigger projects frequently and reusability of components is important. I typically use classes instead. But I'm of the opinion that it's ok to use ID's on small projects. Especially if it's a personal project.
