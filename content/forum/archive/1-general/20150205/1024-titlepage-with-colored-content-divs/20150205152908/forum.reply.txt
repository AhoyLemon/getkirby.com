You definitely want to control the way your website looks with CSS. That's it's purpose, and it's good practice to place your CSS code in a CSS file with a `.css` extension and link your CSS file with a link tag (but it's not required). Example:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/main.css">
```

You can name the CSS file whatever you want. It doesn't have to be `main.css`.  Example:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="purple-people-eater.css">
```

When developing locally or trying ideas, I'll often use a `style` tag within the html document I'm working on so I don't have to keep jumping to a separate file. I find it easier as I develop and at a certain point, I'll move it to a separate document.

```
<style type="text/css">
  /* CSS goes here... */
</style>
```
