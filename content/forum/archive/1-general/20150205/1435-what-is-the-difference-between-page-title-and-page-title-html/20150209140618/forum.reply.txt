Text: For the above example there may not be a difference but I can think of one example in the past where I found one..

I wanted to use a select/dropdown menu in the panel to select an integer from a predefined list (rather than a range). I then wanted to compare that integer to other integers and react accordingly. When I tried this, I was getting errors that stemmed from the fact I was comparing a non integer to an integer. Both the results looked correct so I couldn't figure it out. I couldn't convert it to an int value using php either because the string contained other empty characters that didn't show up or effect it's appearance in the browser in any way (I found this out by counting the characters in the string and outputting the result). Why? I don't know. So I wrapped it in html() and it stripped the extra empty characters and allowed me to convert it to an integer.

I believe I've used a select menu to select integers since and not had this issue though, so it may have been a bug at some point?
