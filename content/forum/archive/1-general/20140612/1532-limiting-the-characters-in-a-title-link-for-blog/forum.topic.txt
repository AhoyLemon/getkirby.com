Text: To begin with, I'm using the basic blog PHP code for linking blog articles into the blog page.

``<a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></a>``

I was wondering how could I limit the characters in the title of the article so that if the title article is longer than say 20 characters, then it would be reduced to something similar as an excerpt would work.

I had tried to make it work by adding the following below

``<a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo html($article->title(), 20) ?></a>``

But it did not work then. Any suggestions on this would be really helpful.
