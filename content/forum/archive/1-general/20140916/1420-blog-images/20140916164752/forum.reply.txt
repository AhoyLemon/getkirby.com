Text: Hey,

first of all it's a smart idea to add


<?php if($article->hasImages()): ?> 

to find out if the blogpost has pictures, because if it doesn't it'll mess things up.

If it indeed has pictures, for myself I am using the thumb plugin which can befound on tutorials. Which looks around like this

<img src="<?php echo thumb($article->images()->first(), array('width' => 180, 'height' => 180, 'crop' => true),false) ?>" .... 
You can easily replace it with finding a certain picture. However when kirby v2 is released it's not really required to use 01, 02, 03 ( for sorting reasons ) anymore, so I'd stick with the first().

Kirby Cheatsheet is a good way to have a shot:
