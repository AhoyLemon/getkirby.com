Text: While trying to figure out how the blog system works, I can't seem to find out how to get my images to work. 

This is what I have at the moment.
< img src='< ?php echo $article->images()->find('01.jpg') ? >' >

The blogpost load correctly, it's just the images that won't. They do give me a working link, tho:
http://localhost/kirby/content/03-referenties/06-folder/01.jpg

My question; Does anyone know, how to get the images from the blog post folder?
