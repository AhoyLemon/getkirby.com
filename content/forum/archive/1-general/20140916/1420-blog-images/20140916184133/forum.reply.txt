Text: The very basic solution to your problem is to add `->url()` to your code. And you might also need `->first()`.

```php
<img src='<?php echo $article->images()->find('01.jpg')->first()->url() ?>'>
```

Right now you're echoing the object (or maybe a list of objects) instead of just the URL of the object.
