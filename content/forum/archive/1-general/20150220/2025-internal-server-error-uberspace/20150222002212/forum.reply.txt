depending on how you setup the host ( i.g. symlinks )  you need to modify the Rewrite Base or you'll get internal server error.

For myself with using symlinks the rewrite base points to the root dir.

RewriteBase /

Depending on your configurations you might want to try changing that to

RewriteBase /FolderWhereYourInstallationIs/

To be honest. I haven't  changing any rewrite though.
