Text: Hello,
I want to ask if kirby has anything similar to what wordpress has, for when you have to clean up a string, e.g. `"nám?ì;`,to something like nam_i.

At the moment I'm using this php code:

````
<?php $curator_url = preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/', '-', strtolower($curator)); ?>
  <a class="curator" href="<?php echo url('curators/' . urlencode($curator_url))?>"><?php echo $curator ?></a>
<?php endforeach ?>
````

to have nice urls, but if there's and accented characters, it's replace with a dash (nám?ì=n-m--) and this break the url.

Any suggestions? It would be nice if kirby would have an internal decoding function.


Thank you,
André

<!-- php thing to replace accented characters to non-accented ones and to transform spaces and special characters (in this case aphostrofe) to minus sign (-))-->
        
<?php
  $accents = '/&([A-Za-z]{1,2})(grave|acute|circ|cedil|uml|lig);/';
  $string_encoded = htmlentities($artist,ENT_NOQUOTES,'UTF-8');
  $artist_cleanurl = preg_replace($accents,'$1',$string_encoded);
        
  $artist_url = preg_replace('/[s'']+/', '-', strtolower($artist_cleanurl)); 
?>
