Text: Hi there,

in the last days I was working on moving my blog to kirby and the result is a little "theme", to turn kirby into a fully functional blog. 

With all features for a blog, but without any styling. (It is more a extension than a theme I think.)

For the download and a more detailed explanation have a look here: https://github.com/ausminternet/blogprint and share your thoughts!

Cheers, Jan
