Text: Hi,

I have built a Kirby site on my local computer, but when I went to upload the files to my site via FTP, I keep getting a Fatal Error:

Warning: require(__DIR__/kirby/bootstrap.php) [function.require]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in .../index.php on line 6

Fatal error: require() [function.require]: Failed opening required '__DIR__/kirby/bootstrap.php' (include_path='.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php') in .../index.php on line 6


The files are there, so I am not sure why I keep getting this error. Has anyone else run into this? 

Thanks!
