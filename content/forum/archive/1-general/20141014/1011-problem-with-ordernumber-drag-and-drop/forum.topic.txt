Text: Hi,
I have installed kirby 2 on my local machine and it works fine.
I'm playing with the starter kit site.
Now I try to change the content in the panel and there is a problem adding  new pages / subpages or change the order of the pages via drag and drop.
If I add a new page e.g. in the projects folder the page is written but without the order numer (e.g. project-d, not  4-project-d).
If I try try to change it via drag and drop nothing happens.

Changing the files in the file system everything works fine.
Any idea?
