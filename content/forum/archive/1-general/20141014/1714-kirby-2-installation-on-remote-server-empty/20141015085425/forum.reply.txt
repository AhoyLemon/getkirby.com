Text: I tried "/subfolder/" which results in the same blank page. Additionally, I just saw that the Console reports:

_Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)_

I reinstalled Kirby 1 in another subfolder and, still, it works well. Are there any further requirements, that Kirby 2 might need?
