Text: Hello,
I just wanted to test Kirby's new version and simply copied (just as for Kirby 1) all files of the StarterKit into a subfolder on my test-server. But opening Kirby 2's url (mydomain.com/subfolder) just shows gives me an empty white page with an empty sourcecode (no 404 Not Found).

Like that, Kirby 1 was running well on the same server. Is there anything more to complete Kirby 2's installation?

The .htaccess is copied aswell and I changed the RewriteBase to "/subfolder".

Thanks for any adviceâ€¦
