Text: Ah, one moment, the php-version. On my provider's page, it was written that my package supports php5.6, but apparently my server was only configured with php5.2.x. I changed it to php5.6 and Kirby 2 runs. Sorry for the confusion.

PS.: To find out about the php-version, I put a info.php with
```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```
on my domain and opened it in the browser.

Thanks thanks
