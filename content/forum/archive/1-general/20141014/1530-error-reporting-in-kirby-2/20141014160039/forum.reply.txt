Kirby 2 has gotten it's own debugger where you can see for errors ( Usually ) which is working fine for me. However i guess depending on your error it might not even show.  Did you just have this problem recently after a chance? Or just when starting on v2?

Is .htaccess setup properly?

Cheers.
