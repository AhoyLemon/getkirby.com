Text: I assume the kirby repo was updated to have error reporting turned off by default. 
This makes sense because you don't want errors and lines of PHP code being exposed to the user if something breaks.

Using the [Multi-environment setup](http://getkirby.com/docs/advanced/options) you can choose to include error reporting only in your local dev environment and not on your production server.

In my config folder I added a new file "config.mysite.dev.php" with the following line of code in it.

    <?php
    c::set('debug', true);

The link above has a pretty clear explanation.
