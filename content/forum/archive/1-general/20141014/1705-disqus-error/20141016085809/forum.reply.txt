Text: I'm sorry but this is completely wrong. You shouldn't modify the snippet at all. If you are using Kirby 1, just use the snippet as is and pass your shortname when including it. 

```php
 <?php snippet('disqus', array('disqus_shortname' => 'MyNewShortName', 'disqus_developer' => true)) ?>
```

If you are using Kirby 2 you have to replace thisURL() with url::current() in the snippet but leave the rest as it is.

I hope this helps.
