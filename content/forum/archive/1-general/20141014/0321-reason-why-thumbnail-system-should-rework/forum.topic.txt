Text: Kirby 2 is here with thumbnail system. It's pretty robust but still have disadvantage. Here is the weakness with current thumbnail systems:
1. With Hash name, sometime kirby generate duplicate thumbnail.

2. With Hash name we've got ugly file name.

3. If we delete the source image, thumbnail is not deleted too. What if client upload 100 image, and then decide to delete post? and they repeat it as time goes by, In long term this file will be problem to disk space. 

4. What if client want to regenerate new thumbnail? sometimes system create bigger thumbnail size. With current thumbnail system, client must hunt troubled thumbnail within central thumbnail folder.

This is by far our current thumbnail system disadvantage I think. 

Anyway, some user already found solution about thumbnail system:

by serving image relative to post path, it easier to hunt down troubled thumbnail. And combined with thumbs folder:

That's it... we've got powerful thumbnail system. With this we can get rid hash name solution and if thumbnail is not automatically deleted once we delete source image, it's easier for user to hunt down troubled thumbnail. Or they can simply delete thumbs folder and let server regenerate thumbnail. It's easier to generate one single post thumbs folder than entire site.

and with thumbnail system as Florent proposed, this is what we gona have:
