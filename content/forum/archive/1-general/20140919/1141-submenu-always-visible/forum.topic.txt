Text: Hi,

I used the Simple nested menu from the Fun with menu's docs:
http://getkirby.com/blog/fun-with-menus

But my submenu isn't always there, for example:
01-home (submenu visible)
-----01-news (submenu visible)
----------01-newsitem (submenu NOT visible).

I assume this is because there are no children left to show. But I want my menu to always show the children from the 01-news folder. No matter what page i'm on. 

I hope it all makes sense...
