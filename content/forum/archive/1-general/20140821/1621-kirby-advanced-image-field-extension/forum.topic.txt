Text: Hey everyone,

Not sure if this is the right thread to post this in, but...

Does anyone know of an extension that allows you to create custom "image fields" in Kirby blueprints?

So instead of having to pull images out of the media folder, you can upload an image specifically for one section of the page?

Or is there an easy, in-built way of doing this that I've missed?

Thanks in advance!
