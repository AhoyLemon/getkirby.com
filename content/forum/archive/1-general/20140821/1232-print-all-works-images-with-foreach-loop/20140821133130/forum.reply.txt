Text: I think in the second snippet it should read

`<img src="<?php echo thumb($image**Lightbox**, array('width' => 300), false) ?>" alt="<?php echo $work->title() ?>">`

and the line `$image = ...`is then superfluos? Otherwise you'd output the same thumb over and over again ...

Are you sure about the find(/works') part of your code? I think it should simply be `find('works')`?
