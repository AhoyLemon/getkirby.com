Text: In each of my blog entry files I have an ID (a carry-over from a MySQL-based CMS). I increment that ID with each new entry, with the goal of using it to create short URLs. I know Kirby creates its own short URLs, but I'd prefer to use these IDs stored in each entry file.

If I know an ID (or the exact, unique value - "1234") of a field in a blog entry, how can I create a template that will auto-forward me to the original entry that has that ID/value?
