Text: I was using this method on Kirby 1.  The following would render my field content in default language, irrespective which language I was using.

 echo($page->content($default)->my_field());

After upgrade to Kirby 2 this doesn't see to be working.  Is there any way to display a field in the default language on a translated page?
