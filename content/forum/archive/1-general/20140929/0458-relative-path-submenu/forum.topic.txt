Text: Hello all I'm in the process of teaching myself the programing skills needed to manage any modifications to my kirby installation myself. I've got the Base Blog theme installed and other than some issues with the submenu. 

I'm going to end up with a page depth beyond 2 levels and I'll need to accommodate that. My thinking is that I'll have a main menu at the top for my level 1 pages, and then a sub menu that displays 1 page down from the current page.

I'd love any thoughts on how I might be able to modify the submenu example from the [menu post](http://getkirby.com/blog/fun-with-menus) so that it displayed the menu based on the relative path of the page it was on.
