Text: the panel is not made for public access. this is more likely your admin interface.

check out v2.getkirby.com within the docs you can find lots of new cool features which could help you getting everything done. however there is no ready script like that yet. so you might require some sort of php knowledge and lots of time as well..

just some things which might come in handy:

http://v2.getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/users/create
http://v2.getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/user/login
http://v2.getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/pages/create
http://v2.getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/page/delete
http://v2.getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/user/delete
http://v2.getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/user/logout

so most of the features are actually quite built in and can be used very easily and effectively. For more information just browse through the docs.
