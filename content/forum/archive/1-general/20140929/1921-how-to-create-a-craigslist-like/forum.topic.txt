Text: Hey guys,

I have the project of making a Craigslist-like website, but dedicated to one city and to sneakers selling.

I really love Kirby, I have very little knowledge (if not any) in PHP, Javascript, and all that stuff. Though, it's really easy to customize and I like it very much. I'll be using Kirby 2.

I wanted to hear from you experts if Kirby is an appropriate framework for that kind of project (I guess it is as it's very flexible).

To post classifieds, you'd have to own an account. Is it possible to use the native Kirby 2 dashboard to manage an account's classifieds without being able to see and edit the rest of the site from the dashboard ?

The content folder would be organised as '/content/your_account_here_321/asics-gel-lyte-v', how can I automatically create a folder when an account is created ?

Thanks in advance !
