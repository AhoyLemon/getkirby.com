Text: Ok, moments later he finds the solution.
reading down on the comments from the mamp instructions I found someone reporting my issue and someonelse posting a solution.
It turns out that the mac os apache installation needs to be told to accept .htaccess files.
exerpt:

I have the same setup. I had to make sure my apache was configured to support .htaccess. (Options Indexes Multiviews FollowSymLinks and AllowOverride All). I store this in my /etc/apache2/user/[username].conf file and it looks like this...

<Directory "/Users/[username]/Sites/">
Options Indexes Multiviews FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

Replace [username] with your username.

After this all I needed to do was restart apache and voil√°!
