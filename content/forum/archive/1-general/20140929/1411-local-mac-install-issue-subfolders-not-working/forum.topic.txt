Text: hello, I am dipping my fingers in kirby for the first time and already got stuck on my local installation.
I am trying to install it on my mac which already has apache and php running (no mamp).
My localhost path looks like this: http://localhost/~renato/
and my kirby site like this http://localhost/~renato/kirby/
I've done all the tweaks as per the mamp setup blog post(http://getkirby.com/blog/mamp), just translating to my situation, so I have
in config.php:
c::set('url', 'http://localhost/~renato/kirby');
c::set('subfolder', '/~renato/kirby');
in kirby's .htaccess:
RewriteBase /~renato/kirby

Kirby's installation home page shows up fine but when I click to test submenus. it gives me the not found message.
I have tried different variations of these parameters with no success.
Any ideas would be much appreciated. I cant wait to test this out...
