Text: Hello,
i will set a logo in two colors for every page. My idea is to use <?php echo html($article->color()) ?> inside a img tag (see below).

< img src="<?php echo url('assets/images/logo-<?php echo html($article->color()) ?>.svg') ?>" alt="<?php echo $site->title()->html() ?>" />

Can anyone help me or has a better idea to solve the problem?

Thanks
