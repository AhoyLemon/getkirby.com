Text: Have you tried using a function instead? Not sure if I understand your $client object needs. It solved an issue I recently had with adding custom settings to static content blocks like header/footer from within the panel. I was sick of constantly typing tons of $page->find()->prop() all over my template again and again.

	<?
	function client($property,$site) {
		$pages = $site->pages();
		$result = $pages->find('client/page/location')->$property();
		return $result;
	}

	echo client('bg',$site);
	?>
