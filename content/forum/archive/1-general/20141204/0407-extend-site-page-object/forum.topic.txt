Text: I have a folder structure whereby I will have many 'client' folders, each populated with projects etc.

While the `$site` object is useful, I was wondering if anyone had any information on how to create my own object; something like `$client` which I could use as follows `$client->bg()`.

Currently I'm struggling to access that level efficiently from templates that could be greatgrandchildren of the 'client' level.

Can someone point me in the right direction? Currently trying to dissect Kirby core.
