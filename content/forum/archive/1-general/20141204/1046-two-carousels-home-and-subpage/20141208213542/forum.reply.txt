Text: You should try to keep your code more abstract, I suggest using a class to define the slider behavior and then you would only need one Javascript call.

Change your slider to
````
<div id="slider1" class="slider">
and
<div id="slider2" class="slider">
````

Then you just need the following:
````
<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function(){
$('.slider').slick({
  infinite: true,
  slidesToShow:1,
  slidesToScroll: 1
});
});
</script>
````

As for the actual problem - can you show a beta site?
