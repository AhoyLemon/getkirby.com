Text: Odd.. it basically looks correct to me, though I'm not familiar with slick's html markup requirements.

The only thing I could think of would be that your stylesheet is loading correctly on home page, because the relative path from there is correct.. but in a subdir, it's not. 

Maybe try

	<?php echo css('/assets/css/slick.css') ?>
