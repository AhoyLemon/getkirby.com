Text: Is there a way to pass automatically images metadata such us links and captions in `kirbytext()`?

I call the content of my article like this
```
<?php echo $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>
```
and I would love to have the output image code like this:
```
<figure>
<a href="#">
<img src="#" alt="alt-text">
</a>
<figcaption>Caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```
without the necessity of writing manually in the textarea this
```
[image: image.jpg   caption: Caption   link:#][^1]
```

Thank you!
[^1]: of course I meant to use these parenthesis ( )
