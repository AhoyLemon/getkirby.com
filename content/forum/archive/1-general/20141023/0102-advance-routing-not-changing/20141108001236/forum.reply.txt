Text: Best wait till Kirby 2 is out of beta and a stable release comes along before using these functions.

I think the documentation and the function just isn't complete yet. 

using:

    c::set('routes', array(
      array(
        'pattern' => '(:any)',
        'action'  => function($uid) {
    
          $page = page($uid);
    
          if(!$page) $page = page('blog/' . $uid);
          if(!$page) $page = site()->errorPage();
    
          return site()->visit($page);
    
        }
      ),
      array(
        'pattern' => 'blog/(:any)',
        'action'  => function($uid) {
          go($uid);
        }
      )
    ));

Doesn't remove "blog" from the url and manually entering the URL without "blog" gives you an error:

Fatal error: Call to a member function isErrorPage() on a non-object in /kirby/kirby.php on line 236

Is this what was meant by (link:https://gist.github.com/bastianallgeier/9df04d2476de9a09698f text:beautiful urls) back in June? I can't seem to find any documentation other then that brief mention of it 5 months ago.
