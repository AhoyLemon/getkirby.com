Text: One way to work around is using different config files for the different domains the same as what u use when working local and remote and put the corresponding urls:

e.g. for your staging domain, use a "config.staging.example.com.php" and set the url to http://staging.example.com and for your production domain, use a "config.production.example.com.php with the url set to http://production.example.com
