I've used Kirby 1 on a client site and all has been great, until today... For seemingly no reason images are not loading. Looking at the console I'm seeing security issues, the site is running on http and Kirby is loading images via https (not sure why).

I've contacted Media Temple (the web host) and they said it's nothing on their end but that it was Kirby. That doesn't make sense 'cause all has been kosher for a good while and no changes have been made on our end.

They were able to get it working by supposedly modifying `site/config/config.php` as follows:

>In this case, the default entry was the following, which you can still see in the backup I made for the file named config.php.mt.bak:
>`c::set('url', false);`

>This was changed to the following entry and the image came back online for the site:
>`c::set('url', 'http://yourdomain.com');`
