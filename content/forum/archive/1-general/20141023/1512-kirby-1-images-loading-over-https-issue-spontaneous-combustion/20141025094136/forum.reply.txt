Text: Hi all,

This happened to me only two days ago... so definitely a new issue. I probed MT about the situation and why this would've suddenly happened. They replied with the answer below. This should clear up why this has happened, albeit not ideal.

> I'll be happy to explain what has changed. New software was pushed out to the Grid; while very little was changed in regards to the configuration of the Grid, there was a change to the server variable $_SERVER['HTTPS']. Previously, this variable was unset, and now it is set to ""; this was required in order to update mod_rewrite on the server to resolve another, unrelated issue.

> In theory, this change should not have had any noticeable effect, but we have discovered after making this change that two major CMS software suites, CodeIgniter and Kirby CMS, will generate links pointed to "https://" if this variable is set to anything other than "Off" instead of explicitly checking to see if this variable is set to "On". This would generally not be considered good coding practice precisely due to situations like this occurring.

> I definitely apologize that this has affected you negatively; if you need assistance with updating anything to accommodate this change, please let us know and we will assist you in any way we can.
