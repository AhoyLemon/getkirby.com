Text: It's really nice that they are trying to blame CodeIgniter and Kirby for it, while just changing the configuration on the server without further notice. However I just pushed an updated version of Kirby 1 to Github, which you can download here: <https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/archive/master.zip> This should fix the problem without having to add the URL manually. Just replace the kirby folder with the new one from the ZIP. Let me know how  this went. 

Cheers, Bastian
