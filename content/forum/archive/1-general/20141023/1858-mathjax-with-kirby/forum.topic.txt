Text: What would be the best way to use (MathJax)[link: http://www.mathjax.org] in Markdown, with Kirby so that I could write:

    Water:   $ H_{2}O $

Without the Markdown in between `$` from rendering, thus allowing the MathJax to render. Since updating to Kirby 2 this has not been a problem. With Kirby 2, it parses Markdown inside the `$` so the MathJax doesn't render.

Any ideas would be appreciated?
