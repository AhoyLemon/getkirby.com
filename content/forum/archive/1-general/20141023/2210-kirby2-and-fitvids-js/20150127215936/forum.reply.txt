Text: A problem I just came across while adding Fitvids was that it wasn't applying the correct aspect ratio to videos. The problem is that Fitvids relies on the width and height attribute of the iframe to determine the aspect ratio. By default Kirby outputs iframe embed code without these attributes.

I fixed it by adding default width and height values (16:9 ratio) in my config:

```
c::set('kirbytext.video.width', '960');
c::set('kirbytext.video.height', '540');
```
