Text: Hey again,

after I successfully switched to kirby 2, my custom 404 error page is gone. Whenever I open a none existing page, I get that default dark error-page, saying "This site is currently not available. Please try again in a couple minutes or contact the administrator.".

How do I get my custom error page running again?

Thanks in advance.
