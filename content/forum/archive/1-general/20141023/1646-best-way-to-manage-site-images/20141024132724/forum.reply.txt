Text: Ah, interesting, ok. A follow up question just so I fully understand:

Do images still need to be contained within `/content/` and can't be placed elsewhere in the site's directory structure?

For example, I have all my CSS/JS/Images within a directory I created in the site root, like this `/assets/css/*` `/assets/js/*` `/assets/img/*`
