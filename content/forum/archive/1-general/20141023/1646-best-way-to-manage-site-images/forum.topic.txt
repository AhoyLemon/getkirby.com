Text: Haven't had any problem with referencing images via the content directory. But I'm curious what's the best approach for general images that might exist site-wide.

For example, something simple like

`<?php image('/assets/images/file.png') ?>`

in varying degrees of use of `$site` or `url()` appendages doesn't seem to work.

Thanks for any feedback!
