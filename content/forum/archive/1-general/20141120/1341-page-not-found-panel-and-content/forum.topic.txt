Text: Hey Guys,

After I've "installed"kirby on my Page  (Yay! If you are seeing this, the installation of Kirby worked. :)" under projectname/news/ and I get always  a 404-Page not found error message when i try to go to the admin panel or a content page.

My Project folder look like this:

"root"(projectname)
- .htaccess
- about
- media
- stores
- news
   - kirby files
- index.php

any solution?
