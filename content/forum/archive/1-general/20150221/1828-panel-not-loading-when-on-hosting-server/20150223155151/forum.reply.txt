Text: Thanks. It ended up being somewhat more simple and due to my inexperience. I thought I copied my .htaccess file over, and that it was just displayed invisibly on my sever like it originally was on my local drive, but it turned out that it was never transferred. I use Transmit as my FTP and that doesn't copy them over. I was told I needed to use FileZilla or some other FTP so I did but it also turns out that if you use Transmit (OS X) you can click View>Show Invisible Files and then you can copy over things like .htaccess
