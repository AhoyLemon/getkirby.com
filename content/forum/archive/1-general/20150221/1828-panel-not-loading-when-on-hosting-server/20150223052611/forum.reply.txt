Text: I had a similar problem when setting up on my VPS (Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit). Apache rewrite wasn't working despite mod_rewrite being active and turned on via the .htaccess file. However, the .htacces file was being ingnored.  I was getting 404s whenever the URL wouldn't correspond to an actual file. 

I found out that my problem was my default Apache Virtual Hosts file located at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`. It read:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

	ErrorDocument 404 /index.html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Turns out, this config file wasn't allowing .htaccess to override default/server wide Apache settings, like mod_rewrite being off by default. I ended up adding the appropriate directives to allow .htaccess to override the settings. This is what my default vhost conf ended up looking like.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html
        <Directory "/var/www/html">
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
	ErrorDocument 404 /index.html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

This fixed my problem. I don't know if this is your case as well, but it wouldn't hurt to check. Hope it helps!
