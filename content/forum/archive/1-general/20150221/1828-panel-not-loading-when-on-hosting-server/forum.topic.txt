Text: Ive loaded my site files onto my server, but when I try to log into the Panel, I get the following error:

      Not Found 
      The requested URL /panel/login was not found on this server.


Any ideas what this could be about? All the folder permissions seem set appropriately (755) and the website works just as it did while locally on my computer running through MAMP. The only exception is I cannot get the panel to load.

Im hosting with MediaTemple on Apache/2.2.22 Server running PHP 5.3.29
