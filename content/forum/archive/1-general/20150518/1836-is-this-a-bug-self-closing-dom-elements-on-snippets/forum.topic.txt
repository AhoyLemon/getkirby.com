Text: Hello there,

I have just started using Kirby and I am trying to build a template. The problem is that I was trying to use a snippet for the header and another for the footer. For my template to work, there are some divs that start open in the header and close in the footer. The problem is that Kirby automatically closes dom elements on each snippet. Is this correct?

Example:

**templates/home.php**

    <?php snippet('head') ?>
    demo
    <?php snippet('foot') ?>

**snippets/head.php**

    <b>

**snippets/foot.php**

    </b>

**The result of this is:**

    <body><b></b>demo</body>

Let me know if there is any way to accomplish what I am trying to do. Thanks in advance!
