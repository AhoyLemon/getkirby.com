Text: Hey everyone,

I'am looking for the best way to resize one image in three sizes.
I need this for a picture gallery, which takes a normal image, one hi-res images for full-screen mode and another as a thumbnail-image.

Is there a way that the user only needs to upload one image in the panel and then the three images/sizes are generated? 

I would take the fullscreen image as the "starting" image. For example: The user always uploads his images in the size 1350x900px. 
From then the normal image is produced in the size 900x600px and the thumbnail image in the size of 150x100px.

Currently my code looks like this:
```
<section>
	<div id="gallery">
	<?php foreach($page->images()->sortBy('sort') as $image): ?>		
	 <a class="rsImg" data-rsbigimg="Fullscreen Image goes here" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" data-rsw="<?php echo $image->width() ?>" data-rsh="<?php echo $image->height() ?>">
<img width="150" height="100" class="rsTmb" src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>">
</a>
	 <?php endforeach ?>
	 </div>
</section>
```

Would be great if someone could help.
Cheers Tim
