Text: Hi Tim,

I had the same problem and solved it by doing:

```
<?php $smallThumb = thumb( $image, array( 'width' => 200, 'height' => 150 ) ) ?>
<img class="rsImg" data-rsThumb="<?= $smallThumb->url() ?>">
```

You can make as many thumb instances of $image as you like. Hope this works for you too.

Regards,
