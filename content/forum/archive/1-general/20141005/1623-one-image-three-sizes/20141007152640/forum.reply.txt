The Thumb-plugin-output is an img-element, but I need a url. But I can use it perfectly for the thumb images :) 

Here a simplified code with some comments:

```
<a data-rsbigimg="url to fullscreen-image" href="url to normal image" data-rsw="width normal image" data-rsh="height normal image">
<img src="url thumb image" width="" height=""  >
```
