Text: Hi,

Just been scratching me head over this, I'm trying to specify a image to use on a page in my text file i.e.

Title: Home
Header: header_bg2.jpg

Now in my header.php I was attempting to use this to display the relevant image on the page:

	<?php $var= $page->files()->find($page->header->value)->uri(); ?>
	<header style="background-image: url('<?php echo $var ?>');">

This works fine for my home page... i.e. $var will echo out something like 'content/01-home/header_bg2.jpg' which is what I need.
However on all other pages I just get the following error:

Fatal error: Call to a member function uri() on a non-object in header.php on line 24

Any ideas? 

All I'm really interested in is finding the current pages folder path.. 'content/01-home/'
