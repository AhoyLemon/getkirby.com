Text: Here is a solution not on a Kirby level, but on a server level, that I found --  in .htaccess, add
```
redirectMatch 301 ^(.*).html $1
```
just before 
```
</IfModule>
```

This said, Kirby v2 **should have never lost advertised functionality** of v1 without notifying the customers. (Apologies if this wasn't advertised functionality, I think it was, or if it was mentioned somewhere in the v2 release notes).
