Text: I have the same issue. The original pre-Kirby project had .html extensions that were not used when converting to Kirby v1, but everything was working fine and a lot of people have kept the bookmarks with .html that were working fine in v1, but are resulting in 404 errors in v2. 

The workaround seems to work fine, but breaks the clean URLs.

Is it possible to have the backwards compatibility brought back officially?.
