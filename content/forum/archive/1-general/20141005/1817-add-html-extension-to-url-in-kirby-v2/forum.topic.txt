Text: Is there an official way to bring back the .html file extension in URLs? Kirby v1 accepts both `/my/url` and `/my/url.html` but with v2 there seems to be no support for .html extensions.

I changed kirby.php line 149 to get this working, but I'm open for a cleaner way ;)

    $page = $site->visit(substr($path, -5) === '.html' ? substr($path, 0, -5) : $path);
