Hello,
I was wondering if there is a way (which files should I look for?) to change the functionality of the link button in the textarea field inside the panel and make it work with the markdown syntax.

As you know, right now it works with the kirbytext syntax, but I'd like to preserve my paragraphs.

Thank you!
