Text: I've been messing around with Kirby this evening, and so far I'm loving it. However, I've run into a problem with Kirby's Markdown Extra parser ([Parsedown Extra](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra)) that's really making a nuisance of itself. [There's a bug](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra/issues/22) where if a footnote contains a line break or multiple paragraphs, the paragraphs get yanked out of the footnote and stuck in the content.

For my use-case, there will almost always be multiple paragraphs in a footnote, so this is really limiting my ability to use Kirby.

This problem doesn't exist in the original Markdown Extra PHP parser.

So, I guess my question is: How can I swap out Parsedown Extra for Markdown Extra?

Thanks!
