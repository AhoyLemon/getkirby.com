Text: Okay, I was able to get this to work. For future reference, this is what I did:

1. Download [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/).
2. Move the `Michelf` folder into `/kirby/vendors/`.
3. Open up the `/kirby/helpers.php` file, and paste this in just under `<?php`:

        // Set-up for using Markdown Extra
        require_once 'vendors/Michelf/MarkdownExtra.inc.php';
        use Michelf\MarkdownExtra;

4. Find the `markdown()` function in the file. Comment-out all of the lines **except** this one:

        $kirby = kirby::instance();

5. Just before the function closing bracket (`}`), paste this line in:

        return MarkdownExtra::defaultTransform($text);

6. Done!
