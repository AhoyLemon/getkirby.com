Text: Hello! 

Currently I have a client's portfolio website with a list of her projects (which are divided into subfolders), and I am using this to fetch them, which is working great:

    $projects_landscape = $pages->visible()
                            ->children()
                            ->filterBy('tier', '1')
                            ->filterBy('orientation', 'landscape')
                            ->shuffle()
                            ->limit(3);

However, now the client wants each project in each directory to be represented, and I am having trouble with this part. I have three separate variables, but am having trouble combining them into one object that I can loop through. I'm also not very familiar with PHP so any help would be much appreciated! This is what I have so far: 

    $projects_landscape_advertising = $pages->visible()
                                        ->children()
                                        ->find('advertising')
                                        ->filterBy('tier', '1')
                                        ->filterBy('orientation', 'landscape')
                                        ->shuffle()
                                        ->limit(1);

    $projects_landscape_editorial = $pages->visible()
                                        ->children()
                                        ->find('editorial')
                                        ->filterBy('tier', '1')
                                        ->filterBy('orientation', 'landscape')
                                        ->shuffle()
                                        ->limit(1);      

    $projects_landscape_packaging = $pages->visible()
                                        ->children()
                                        ->find('packaging')
                                        ->filterBy('tier', '1')
                                        ->filterBy('orientation', 'landscape')
                                        ->shuffle()
                                        ->limit(1);`
