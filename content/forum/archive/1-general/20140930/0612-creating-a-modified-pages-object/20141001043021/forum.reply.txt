Text: Option 2 is exactly what I need. Thanks so much @fitzage. And thanks for your reply also, @texnixe!  

It doesn't matter now, but to clarify, the problem was that the client wanted 3 random projects to show up on the home page, but sometimes it would return 3 projects all from the Editorial section (since there were so many more pages in that subfolder than the others). So I was trying to change the logic so that it pulls one random project from each subfolder. Option 2 works like a charm.
