Text: I'm not 100% sure what you are wanting to accomplish here, so I can give you a couple of solutions.

1. If all three of these items are under the same parent, and have no other visible siblings, you can just use `->children()->children()` to get the children of all three folders in one list. By that I mean if your structure is something like this:

```
01-projects
    01-advertising
        01-whatever
        02-whatever
    02-editorial
        01-whatever
        02-whatever
    03-packaging
        01-whatever
        02-whatever
```

Then to display all the grandchildren on the main projects page, you can get them by `$page->children()->children()` and you'll end up with all the "whatevers" in one list and can filter accordingly.

2. If you need more granularity, pull them separately as above, and then use this little-known weird trick (sorry, couldn't resist the link-bait phrasing):

```php
<? $allprojects = Pages::merge($projects_landscape_advertising, $projects_landscape_editorial, $projects_landscape_packaging) ?>
```

Then you just use the $allprojects as one big list and treat it like any other Kirby pages object.

I see since you seem to be wanting just the most recent item from each, the second option would be better, but keep the first one in mind for when you want that functionality.
