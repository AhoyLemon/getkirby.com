Text: I am not 100% sure, but you can access the current kirby instance using the kirby function (it will create a new instance if none exists)

```php
$pages = kirby()->site()-pages();
```

instead of 

```php
$kirby = kirby::instance();
$pages = $kirby->site()->pages();
```

but i think your solution is right @iksi :)
