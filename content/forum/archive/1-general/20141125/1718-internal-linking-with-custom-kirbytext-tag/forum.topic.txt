Text: I am using [the documentation on 'Extending Kirbytext'](http://getkirby.com/docs/advanced/kirbytext) to try and add a new tag to Kirbytext. I found out that you can access the current page and its files using the $tag->page() and $tag->file() method. Is it however also possible to access and search through other pages?
I'm trying to look for a page (somewhere inside the website) with a specific name and display the title, link and first image. The code I have looks like this and doesn't work (obviously):

	<?php
	
	kirbytext::$tags['fiche'] = array(
	  'html' => function($tag) {
	
	  	$itemname = $tag->attr('fiche');
	
	  	// Try to find the page corresponding to the name
	  	$item  = $pages->index()->findBy('uid', $itemname);
	 
	  	$url   = $item->url();
	  	$thumb = $item->images()->first()->url();
	
	
	    $html = '<a href="'.$url.'">'.$itemname.'</a>';
	    $html .= '<img src="'.$thumb.'"/>';
	    return $html;
	  }
	);
	?>

This kind of chips in with previous questions on how to easily link internally from the panel or through kirbytext â€“ so any clues on how to do that are also welcome!
