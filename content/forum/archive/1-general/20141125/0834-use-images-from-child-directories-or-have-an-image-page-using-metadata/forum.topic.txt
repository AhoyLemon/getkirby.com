Text: Is there a  way to have a single 'attachment page' (to use Wordpress terminology) without having to have subfolders?

What I would like is a structure like the following

```
client/project/
|-- project.md (a gallery of thumbs)
|-- image1.png
|-- image1.png.md
|-- image2.png
|-- image2.png.md
|-- image3.png
|-- image3.png.md
```

But have each image on it's own page/url using the content from the metadata.

Alternatively I will have to have a structure like the following:

```
client/project/
|-- project.md (a gallery of thumbs)
|-- /page-1/
    |-- image1.png
    |-- image1.png.md
    page.md
|-- /page-2/
    |-- image2.png
    |-- image2.png.md
    page.md
|-- /page-3/
    |-- image3.png
    |-- image3.png.md
    page.md
```

and try and access the images from the child folders.

Any suggestions  / ideas?
