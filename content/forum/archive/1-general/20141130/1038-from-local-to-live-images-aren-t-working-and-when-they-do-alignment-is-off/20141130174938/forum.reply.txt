Text: For my image problem, the permissions were somehow all 640 instead of 644. This only affected files I have added to the folder without using the Kirby admin interface. 

For my second problem, oddly enough, eliminating all left-margin didn't squish them together enough to effect a change.

Something I noticed- the "Services" section is my 4th block, but it's all the way in what you'd expect the 6th block to be, as if it had margin 65% or so. The two lower blocks order themselves properly. If I give it a negative margin, it places itself on the top line, instead of moving left. I'm pretty mediocre at CSS so I'm not sure what I should be gathering from this as to a solution.
