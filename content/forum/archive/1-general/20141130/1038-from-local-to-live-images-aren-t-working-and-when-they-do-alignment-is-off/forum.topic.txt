At this neighborhood community site I'm working on, I'm having trouble getting the images to show for some reason. I'm quite new to Kirby 2. On localhost they showed up fine, but after transferring over they're not.

More importantly is the alignment of each element. I can't seem to get aligned- the 1st block on the 2nd row always seems to have extra white space to the left, throwing off the other blocks. What's weird is that the alignment problem looks different on localhost, but that may be because the images are broken and not taking up any space on the server.
