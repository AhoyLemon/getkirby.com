Text: Hi and thanks,

but that is NOT working for me. Your example is the way I normally expected it to work:

`<a href="/path/to/page">Whatevs</a>`

Let's say I have this structure. The folder "content" is just here to show that I am in the content and not in the template folder:

`content/products/product1`
`content/company/about`

My website is at http://localhost/test.

When I call e.g. http://localhost/test/products/product1 and within the content file of product1 I like to link to company/about I get the following results:

<code>( link: company/about) => http://localhost/test/company/about</code>

<code>< a href="company/about"> => http://localhost/company/about</code>

So the root folder (subfolder) seems to be missing in the manual a link.

Maybe it's a configuration problem but everything else works fine.

My config:

`c::set('url', 'http://localhost/test');`
`c::set('subfolder', 'test');`
