Text: Hi,

first, kirby is amazing - thank you!

Everything works super fluent for me, except one thing I haven't figured out yet.

In my content files I address other pages with the "(link:" or "(image:" kirbytext which works well.

But sometimes I need to use a manual "< a href" because I need more data in the tag or I need a manual link around an image, etc. and in these cases I found no way to produce the correct URL path for the manual link.

I need something like:

< a href = "(urlpath: content/page)">......</a>

Where urlpath creates "http://mywebsite/content/page".
