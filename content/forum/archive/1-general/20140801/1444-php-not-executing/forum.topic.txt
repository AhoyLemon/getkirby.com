Text: I am trying out Kirby, and putting a simple PHP script ('echo hello world') in the tutorial file.

This PHP is not executing when the project page is viewed in Kirby (for example to show a list of images). 

When accessing a .php file directly it IS executing, so the problem is not with my server.

My question: where to put the PHP code in a Kirby page? Do I have to enable PHP for .txt files?
