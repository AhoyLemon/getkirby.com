Text: I am trying to add a nav to allow people to walk through all pages of my site and running into a couple issues.

For top level pages which contain children, I would like to have a link to the first child page. This renders, but it's showing the url of a page number 4. **How can I get the first child?**

    <?php if ($page->hasChildren()): ?>
        <?php $children = $page->children(0,1);?>
        <?php foreach ($children as $child): ?>
           <a id="page_arrow_next" href="<?php echo $child->url() ?>"></a>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    <?php endif ?>


I would also like to have a nav which shows all sibling pages, this renders but the href is blank. **How do I get the page's url?**

     <? foreach($page->siblings() as $sibling): ?>
            <a href="<?= $sibling->pageURL(); ?>"><span></span></a>
     <? endforeach ?>
