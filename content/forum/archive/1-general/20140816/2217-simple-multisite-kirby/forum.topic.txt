Text: Hello there 

I'd like to know if there is a way to make Kirby multisite. Let me explain: 
I like to have a single installation Kirby. Then be able to appoint Kirby a set of folders that would be new sites, such as: 
- "Content-mysite01" 
- "Content-mysite02" 
We would then have addresses like this: 
- http://kibysite.com/mysite01/home 
- http://kibysite.com/mysite02/home 

These sites share the same template, the same plug-ins, the same snippets 
What interested me particularly it would be able to place the content files outside the installation folder on a NAS for example. 

The ideal would be to add a content directory in the config file on the primary site. It would be ideal to be able to change the behavior of Kirby by a plug-in.
