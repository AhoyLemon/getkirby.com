Text: Hi there,

I extended Kirbytext with a lightweight lightbox and a lightbox gallery (using Featherlight.js).

The lightbox  extension works just fine. The Gallery always causes the Kirbytext parser to stop parsing markdown after the lightbox. With Links at  the bottom of the file (footnote notation), these links break. 
What is kinda weird to me, is that e.g. a Lightbox after the gallery works fine. The rest stays broken though.

My /site/tags/gallery.php looks like this: 

		<?php
		kirbytext::$tags['gallery'] = array (
		'attr' => array (
		  'title', 'thumbWidth', 'thumbHeight'
		),
		  'html' => function($tag) {
			$images = explode("|", $tag->attr('gallery'));
			  $galleryTitle = $tag->attr('title', 'Gallery');
			$thumbWidth = $tag->attr('thumbWidth', '100');
			$thumbHeight = $tag->attr('thumbHeight', '100');
			$return = '<h3>'.$galleryTitle.'</h3>';
			  foreach($images as $image) {
				  $return .= '<a class="thumbnail gallery" href="'.$tag->file($image)->url().'"><img src="'.thumb($tag->file($image), array('height' => $thumbHeight, 'width' => $thumbWidth, 'crop' => true))->url().'"></a>';
			  }
			  return $return;
		  }
		);
		?>

A demo site with the gallery that is broken can be found [here](http://www.slowcarber.de/test-gallery) and a site that isn't broken (since it doesn't have gallery but a link) can be found [here](http://www.slowcarber.de/test-no-gallery).

Any clues what I am doing wrong?
