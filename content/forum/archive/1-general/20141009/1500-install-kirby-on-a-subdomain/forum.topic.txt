Text: I placed all kirby files in a subfolder at the root of my server called '/next'.
I pointed a subdomain beta.domain.com to that folder. 

The homepage works like a charme but when I try to view the other pages i.e. 'about' I get "Internal error server". In my htaccess I wrote ``RewriteBase /next``.

Am I missing something?

Thanks for any advice
