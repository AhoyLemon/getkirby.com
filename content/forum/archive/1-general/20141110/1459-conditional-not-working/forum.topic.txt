Text: I'm have trouble with a conditional statement.  I have a bit of navigation code that looks like this...

```
<?php foreach($pages->visible() as $page): ?>
    <li>
      <a <?php e($page->isOpen(), ' class="active"') ?> href="<?php echo $page->url() ?>"><?php if($page->short()): echo $page->short(); else: echo $page->title(); endif ?></a>
    </li>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

The else: echo $page->title() portion does not want to work; it returns nothing, although there is a title field in my pages.  The if($page->short()): echo $page->short() seems to be working fine for those pages that have a short field.  If I remove the conditional statement and simply put  echo $page->title(), the title then renders fine.

For the life of me, I'm not able to figure out why this statement doesn't want to work.

Thanks in advance for any assistance.
