Text: Hello Kirby community

I am a German users of this CMS and would like to implement tags in the blog. I just read the English instructions but still do not understand how I can do that.

In the (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/solutions/blog/tags text: Anleitung) is that you have to insert three rows somewhere. I do not get it. Do you still create a new file and get these three lines as in the manual is in the blogarticle.txt?

Would be grateful for any tip !!
