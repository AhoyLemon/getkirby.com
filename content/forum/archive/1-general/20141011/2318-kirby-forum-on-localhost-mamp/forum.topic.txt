Text: hey, 

I managed to get the forum up and running on my localhost using MAMP but when I click the "sign in with twitter" I get an ERROR page saying the site is not available at the moment. 

Looking at the files I don't see any login.php file anywhere so where does the : <?php echo url('login') ?> come from ? 

any help appreciated thanks
