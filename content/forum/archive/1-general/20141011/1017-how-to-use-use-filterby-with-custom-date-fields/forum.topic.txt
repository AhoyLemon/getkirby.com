Text: Hi. Love Kirby. I'm still pretty new to all of this and I've managed to get stuck!

I'm using two different date fields, so in addition to 'date' I've added another one in blueprints called 'stopdate'.  I can use filterBy with 'date', but I can't get it to work with my custom date.

There's probably better ways to do this, but what I'm trying to do is to return the one page with a 'stopdate' closest to today's date (not including past dates). Like, for showing upcoming events.

Works:
```
$a = $site->find('a')->children()->filterBy('date', '>=', strtotime('today'))->sortBy('date', 'asc')->first()
```
Doesn't work:
```
 $a = $site->find('a')->children()->filterBy('stopdate', '>=', strtotime('today'))->sortBy('date', 'asc')->first()
```
Results in:
> Notice: Object of class Field could not be converted to int in /kirby/toolkit/lib/collection.php on line 545

I don't feel confident messing around in collection.php. Is there any way I can use/convert the 'stopdate' directly inside the filterBy? I've been at this for a couple of hours now, but I guess this might not be possible?  (or more likely: I don't know what I'm doing)

I appreciate any feedback!
