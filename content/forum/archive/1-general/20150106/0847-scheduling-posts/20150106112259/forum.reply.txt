Text: @mydarktime They are invisible by default, but I think @sulcalibur is looking for a solution to automate the process.

So one way of doing it, would be to make the folder visible and in the template pull all visible children that meet the condition that their date is before and including today. 

```php
<?
    $currentDate = strtotime(date("Y-m-d"));
    $articles = page('blog')->children()->visible()->sortBy('date')->flip();
 
    foreach($articles as $article) :
         if($article->date() <= $currentDate)  {
              //do stuff
        }
    endforeach;
?>
```
