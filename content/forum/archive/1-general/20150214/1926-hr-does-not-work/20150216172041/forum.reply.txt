Text: Four dashes are reserved by Kirby to separate different fields. If I put some asterisks into my textfile like so:

```php
    Some text ...
    ****
    Some more text
```

And in my template:

``` php
<h1><?php echo $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
<?php echo $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>
```

The the result looks like this
