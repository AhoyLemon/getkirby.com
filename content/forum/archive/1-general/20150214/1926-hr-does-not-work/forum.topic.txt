Text: I'm new to Kirby, but have been tinkering with html/css for a few years. I want to add a hr-element to my page, but no matter what I do, it won't show up. I've tried the following:

**** (etc.)
a basic hr-element

For example, I've created an inline table and for example br-element does work. 

Why can't I add a simple hr-element?
