Ok, I tried to directly edit the txt-file. It actually has 2 hr:s as default marked like this "----". The weird thing is, If I do exactly the same and add one more hr with "----", it does not show up :/ I also tried the asterisk(s), but nothign happens.

What do you mean by this: "What code are you using to render the html?"

Thanks :)
