Text: Hi everybody :-)

I would like to know how you guys handle your customs error pages?!
Do you use "response::error" or "response::header" from the toolkit api?

How is Kirby handling with errors generally? 
Is everything returned to the error.php under templates? No matter if it's a 404 or a 500?

Would be great to hear some different approaches :-)

Cheers,
Tim
