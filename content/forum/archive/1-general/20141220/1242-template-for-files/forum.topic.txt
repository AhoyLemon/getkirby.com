Text: I'm creating a filebrowser based on kirby and it worked really well so far. The only thing i'm struggling with is the following.

When clicking on a file, lets say `file.pdf` i would like kirby to show a modal window providing information about that file and a download link.

So my first approach ist to provide that information via `data` attributes on the specific link and using Jquery to read that info and generate the window.

Is there a way i could request that information via PHP by creating a template specific for files or using kirby controllers ?
