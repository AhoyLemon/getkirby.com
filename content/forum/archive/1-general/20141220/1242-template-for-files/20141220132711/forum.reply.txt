Text: i'll probably stick with the data-attributes and Jquery solutions but i just thought about the possibillity to pass information via url to a file, called fileinfo.php in this case. 

```
<a href="<?php echo url('fileinfo/url:' . urlencode( $file->url() ) ) ?>">
     <?php echo $file->filename() ?>  		
</a>
```

i could the get the information related to the files url and load the result via Ajax. But it seems a lot of work for no advantage over the other solution.
