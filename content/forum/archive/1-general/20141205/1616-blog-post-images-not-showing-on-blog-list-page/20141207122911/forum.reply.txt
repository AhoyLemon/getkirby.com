Text: I use a function getFirstPara that I place in the plugins folder which gets all content before and including the first ending paragraph tag.

```php
<?php 
   function getFirstPara($string){
        $string = substr($string,0, strpos($string, "</p>")+4);
        return $string;
    } 
?>
```
@takaminacchan's suggestion certainly has many advantages content-wise, because you can write a real summary, but more work ...
