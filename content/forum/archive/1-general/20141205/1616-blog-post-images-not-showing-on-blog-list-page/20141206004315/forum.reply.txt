Text: Oh my, I figured it out (face palm).  The `excerpt->()` method strips html tags from the content. I can use this to have images shows properly:

```php
<?php echo $article->text()->kirbytext(); ?>
```

Obviously that shows the complete articles, but I could write an excerpt style method that would not strip html. Although then I would have to make sure that I am not truncating the text part way in some tag ...
