Text: You are right @texnixe I am trying to return the content object of a page which was loaded via the controller (not the current page). 

How am I able to debug my data if a::show is showing the entire object rather then the specific item you are passing it? It's pretty important during development to be able to show what something contains. 

Also in your demo - I am a little confused about what is going on with the compact. Why are you setting it as a local variable like that and then using compact. Can't you just pass an object around like a more traditional model?
