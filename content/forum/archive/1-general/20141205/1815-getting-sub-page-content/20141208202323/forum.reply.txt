Text: @crisp_concepts : I am trying to get the entirety of a page's content, not just one field. So I am TRYING to call the built-in function. Do you know why content() would not work as designed and instead is outputting the entire Kirby object.

To give you some details on what specifically I want to do - this is a custom controller which will be used for an overview page. Based on some logic I want to fetch a certain children's content and display it on the overview page (instead of overview).
