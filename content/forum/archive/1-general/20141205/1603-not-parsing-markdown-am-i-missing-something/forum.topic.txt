Text: I'm currently converting a PSD into a Kirby site. I'm loving it so far, but I'm finding that markdown doesn't seem to be working. Line/paragraph breaks, italics, headlines, etc aren't being inserted, it's just displaying everything (including the MD syntax( as a single paragraph.

Am I missing something or doing something wrong?
