Text: anyone capable to giving some example api calls with the remote function which is available in the kirby toolkit?

(link: https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/blob/master/lib/remote.php)

 I am really looking out to figure out how to get work with out but not having much insight with that function as there is no documentation whatsoever so far.

Cheers,
