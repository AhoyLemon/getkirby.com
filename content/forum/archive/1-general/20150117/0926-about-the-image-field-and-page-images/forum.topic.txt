Text: 1) How can i add new image field type single or even multiple? For ex: i want to use groupped images on homepage. Slider images, footer images, content images. I cant use page images for all. Is there a image field type? I couldnt find.. 

Expected usage:

      fields:
        title:
          label: Title
          type:  text
        text:
          label: Text
          type:  textarea
        slider:
          label: Slider
          type:  image
          width: 900
          height: 400

2) And can i add title and description to each page images for example of using on slider title and caption?

Thanks
