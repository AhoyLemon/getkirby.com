Text: You can find all available fields here: (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/#panel-fields) – so no, there's no image field. You could build one yourself though…

I'm using another solution (not the best, indeed, but works out quite nice for me and my clients). Just using a naming pattern for your images, e.g. all images which should appear in a slider have to include 'slider' in their name, e.g. 'slider_1.jpg', 'sweet-cat_slider.png', or whatever. Then you are filtering your images like this:

    $images = $page->images()->filterBy('filename', '*=', 'slider');    
    foreach($images as $image){
        // code for each image
    }

More information on filtering: (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/advanced/filter-methods)

For your second question, have a look at (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints/file-settings text: file fields).

**Edit:** Looks like the file/image field for blueprints is already planned and in development: (link: https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/54) :)
