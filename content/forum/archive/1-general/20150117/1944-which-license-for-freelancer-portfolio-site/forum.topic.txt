Text: So my first instinct would be that for a freelancer's "business" site the "personal license" would be appropriate(most cms' I've use seem to place portfolio sites in this category), but the description states that it is only for non-commercial personal sites, which makes me think of things like personal blogs, wedding sites, local meetup sites, and stuff like that. A portfolio site that is used as a way to attract leads and therefore earns you money is certainly commercial. So does that mean that the $99 professional plan would be the appropriate license? Because that seems a little steep for a simple portfolio site.

I get the impression Bastian is not really a stickler about this sort of thing, but I don't want to shortchange him either.
