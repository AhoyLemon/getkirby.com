Text: I guess it's documented somewhere but I can't remember where that was, when updating it's always a good idea to check what has been changed (release notes, commit messages in github repos).

As regards your new error. The a.php on line 414 is the sort function, and it requires an array as input. Looks like your trying to sort an object instead.
