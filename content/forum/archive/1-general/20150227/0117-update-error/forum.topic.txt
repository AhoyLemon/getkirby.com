Text: I just updated from 2.0.1 to 2.0.6 and get the following error:

Fatal error: Cannot redeclare thumb() (previously declared in /home/iprof/public_html/kirby/toolkit/helpers.php:278) in /home/iprof/public_html/site/plugins/thumb.php on line 6

When I updated, I only copied the panel and kirby folders via FTP.

Thanks for any help!
