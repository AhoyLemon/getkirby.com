Text: Hello! So I seem to be stuck in the same rut — and I am using this thread to troubleshoot. It’s been quite helpful. However, the comment numbers still aren’t showing up at all. 

I renamed my snippet disquscount.php from count.php.

This is the current code in my snippet:

```
<?php
$shortname = "sasharae";
$url = 'http://' . $shortname . '.disqus.com/count.js?q=1&0=1,' .  $identifier;

$countJs = @file_get_contents($url);

str_replace(' ', '', $countJs);

if(preg_match('/DISQUSWIDGETS.displayCount((.*))/si', $countJs, $matches)) {
    $count_json = @json_decode($matches[1], true);
    $count = $count_json['counts'][0]['comments'];
    echo $count; // echo the comment count
} else {
    echo "-"; // No comments or could not get data
}
```

And I am using this for my blog page:

```
 <a href="<?php echo url($article->uri()) ?>#disqus_thread"> <i class="fa fa-comment"></i> <?php snippet("disquscount", array("identifier" => $article->uri())); ?></a>
```

Just wondering if anyone can point out where I’ve gone wrong. Thanks!
