Text: Hi,

Pre: I am looking for a new CMS for a new blog. My old blog runs on Serendipity and for this I wrote a simple RegeEx parser to find hanshtags and link them to the site search. This dos not work well, since S9Ys search uses the full text index of MySQL which ignores the #-character.

What I am trying to accomplish is: I write a blog entry or any other content using hashtags the standard way as #hashtag and in a slightly more advanced way like #(hashtag)s and #(hashtag-party). The brackets make the hashtag more explicit, since the standard hashtags defined by Twitter stop at chars like - or spaces. This is funny at Twitter, where you can write thinks like #hashtag s just to satisfy both your singular hashtag and your plural meaning in the sentence. Nevertheless, in my blog I need such a hashtag parser, which renders the hashtag as a link and removes the brackets. Later it could render a webcomponent custom tag or something which gives a rich tooltip. This sort of stuff.

Question: Has anyone a good idea, how I could accomplish this within Kirby? Write an extension? This syntax is not Kirbytext, so the best way would be an extension to the Markdown(-Extra)-parser. In S9Y I run a RegEx-Replace before the Markdown-parser gets the content, bus this seems quite fragile to me and is just a quick workaround. Just extending the Markdown-parser won't work, because the rendered HTML needs at least a context-specific search url and when webcomponents enter the stage, all gets more complicated.

So, ideas anyone?
