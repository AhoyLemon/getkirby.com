Text: Hi guys

I'm using kirby as a way of managing notes on scientific papers. These papers often have multiple authors. 

I'm running into a problem though. Say there are three papers from someone called Burnstock:

Paper 1: Title 1 by Burnstock
Paper 2: Title 2 by Helper and Burnstock
Paper 3: Title 3 by Someone Else and Burnstock and Helper

How would you lay out the content for this? Currently I just have this:

content/1-Papers/Burnstock-1/paper.txt
content/1-Papers/Burnstock-2/paper.txt
content/1-Papers/Burnstock-3/paper.txt

But really I'd like to have the following:

content/1-Papers/Burnstock/paper-1.txt (title 1)
content/1-Papers/Burnstock/paper-2.txt  (title 2)
content/1-Papers/Helper/paper-1.txt (title 3, with some reference to the Burnstock folder)

But then I can't use custom templates if I don't know how many paper-X there are. 

Hopefully you guys can help!
Thanks
