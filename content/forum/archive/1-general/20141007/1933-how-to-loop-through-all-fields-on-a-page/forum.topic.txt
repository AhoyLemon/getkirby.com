Text: I just started out with Kirby and have been looking through the documentation and forum but I can't find it: how do you loop through all fields associated with a page? For instance I have a contact blueprint with an email address, location, website, phone number, etc. I know how to display them one by one in my contact template, but how do you display them all in a loop?
