Text: An answer to my original question, here is how to display all field names associated with a page, followed by their values:

```
<?php
$c = $page->content();
foreach ($c as $key => $value) {
  if ($key == "fields") {
    foreach ($value as $field) {
      echo $field . ": " . $page->$field() . "<br/>";
    }
  }
}
?>
```

This example is extremely basic, consider it a starting point.
