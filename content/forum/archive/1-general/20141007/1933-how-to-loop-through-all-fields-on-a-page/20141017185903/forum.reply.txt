Text: Could you give me an example of how that would work please? I followed the link you posted and added 'addresses' to my template blueprint. And now I have a page with some addresses added through the panel. How do I display these addresses nicely in my template? When I do this, it shows the name of the template, page, fieldname and then all addresses on one line:

```
foreach ($page->addresses() as $address) {
	echo $address . "<br/>";
} 
```
