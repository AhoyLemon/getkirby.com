Text: Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is an issue with Kirby 2 or my setup with Cloudflare's new (and FREE) [Universal SSL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/).

Basically when I'm browsing my site over HTTPS and using url() in my code, the outputted URL always begins with "http://". This becomes an issue because while the page is HTTPS, all of the links and images are using HTTP.

This is what I had that was still outputting over HTTP:

    <?php foreach($item->images() as $image): ?>
    <a href="<?php echo $item->url(); ?>">
        <img src="<?php echo $image->url(); ?>" />
    </a>
    <?php endforeach; ?>

This is what I'm doing as a workaround:

    <?php foreach($item->images() as $image): ?>
    <a href="<?php echo '/' . $item->uri(); ?>">
        <img src="<?php echo '/content/' . $item->diruri() . '/' . $image->filename(); ?>" />
    </a>
    <?php endforeach; ?>

The workaround works but I'm hoping there's a more elegant solution. And again, I'm not sure if this is because of Cloudflare's end with their new Universal SSL.

Any ideas??
