Text: Finally fixed it. I think this was a combination of a few things:

* upgraded to 2.0.1 after Bastian's suggestion over email
* enabled Secure Hosting for my domains on my web host (Dreamhost)
* on Cloudflare, set my domains to use "Full SSL" (which I just realized is FREE!)
* in my configs, I have c::set('ssl', true);

Now everything is properly redirecting to https, and I don't have to pay for an SSL certificate for my personal blog, courtesy of Cloudflare. =]

I f'ing love Kirby.
