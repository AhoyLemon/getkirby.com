My work has been growing to the point where my crude project management system - i'm using index cards and binder clips - is no longer holding up.

Does anyone have any recommendations for basic project management software? Simple is better, I'm just looking for something lightweight to keep track of info, invoicing, and so on, per project.

Any thoughts?
