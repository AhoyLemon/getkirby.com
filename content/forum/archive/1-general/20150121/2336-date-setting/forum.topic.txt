Text: I define a date in my post.txt like this:
```
Date: 01/12/2014
```
Then i use the following code to get the date inside my template:
```
<?php echo $data->date('d/m/Y') ?>
```
And the generated output looks like this, where day and month are inverted:
```
12/01/2014
```
Is there a way to define how the date should be parsed from the textfile ?
