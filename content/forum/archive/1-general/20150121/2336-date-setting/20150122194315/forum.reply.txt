Seems to be sorting the date fine for me.
Here's the related blueprint field for reference as well. Are you using "type: date"?

	  date:
	    label: Publish Date
	    type:  date

And a sample from a content file:

	Date: 2015-01-06

If I change to your format:

	Date: 01/06/2015

It still displays correctly as: "06/01/2015"
