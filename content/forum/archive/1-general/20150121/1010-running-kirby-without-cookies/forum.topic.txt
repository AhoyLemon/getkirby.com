Text: I see the PHPSESSID cookie popping up.

Is it possible to get rid of it?
Is it possible to get rid of for anonymous users?

I'm planning to run Kirby behind Varnish, and sending a cookie from php is not 'good' for cacheing.

I see the need for a cookie in the panel, but not in the generated website.

Drupal has already done this:
"Drupal should support disabling anonymous sessions"

Thanks for helping me out!
