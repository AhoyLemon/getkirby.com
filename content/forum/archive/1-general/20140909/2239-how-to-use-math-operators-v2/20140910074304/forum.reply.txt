Text: Those numbers are strings, you'd have to convert them into numbers first:

e.g

    <?php
        $parter = int($page->parter());
        $mansarda = int($page->mansarda());
        $sum = $parter + $mansarda;
    ?>

In this case I used "int", but depending on your numbers you might prefer "float" or whatever.
