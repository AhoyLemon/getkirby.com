Text: Hey,

I have been playing around with the built in mysql functions and I have been wondering how to use $_POST values the db::query function. 

I also had issues to call the $result = db::query - more likly echo the array. All it was showing me was either nothing or "Array". 

Can someone provide a simple example for both of those things?

I'd appreciate it.

Cheers
