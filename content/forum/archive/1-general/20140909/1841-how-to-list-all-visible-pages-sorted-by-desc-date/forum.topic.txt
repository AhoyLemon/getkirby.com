Text: Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is an issue with Kirby v2 Beta or I'm doing something wrong but I can't figure this out. I've tested many similar code snippets from the forum but it doesn't seem to be working properly. Right now I have this:

    $site->index()->visible()->flip()->limit(50)

I'm expecting this to list out the fifty most recent visible pages, descending date order. However, this is actually listing out the 50 most recent visible pages, but *grouped* by parent page name, in reverse alphabetical order of the parent page names.

Kinda hard to explain but hopefully you guys know what I'm talking about.

Any suggestions?
