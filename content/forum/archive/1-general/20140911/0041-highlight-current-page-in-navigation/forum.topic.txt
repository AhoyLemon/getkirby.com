Text: Can I somehow highlight the current page in my navigation? You know - I click on 'page 1' in the navigation and 'page 1' changes colour. 

I think I can somehow use $pages->active() to set an id name in my <li> and then style that id name in my stylesheet, but I can't figure out how. 

Can anyone help?
