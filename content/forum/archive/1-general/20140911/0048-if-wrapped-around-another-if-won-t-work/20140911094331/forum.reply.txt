Text: Well, that depends on what you want to achieve. In your example above, the second "if" will only work if the first if is true and the second as well.

Otherwise, if you want to do one thing if first "if" is true and another if the second "if" is true then the two "if" statements shouldn't be nested:

    <?php if($tag->name() == 'new'): ?>
         ... do some stuff ...
    <?php endif ?>
    
    <?php if($work->text() != ''): ?>
         ... do some other stuff ...
    <?php endif ?>
