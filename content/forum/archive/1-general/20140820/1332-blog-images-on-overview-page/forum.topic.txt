Text: hello there,

i'm using kirby for a blog. and in the detail pages (post.php) for each blog posts the images are rendered successfuly. but, and that's why i'm asking:

if i use image: foo.png, it will not rendered on articles.php, cause they try to find the image in http://localhost/foo.png, and not in the right folder.

any idea?
