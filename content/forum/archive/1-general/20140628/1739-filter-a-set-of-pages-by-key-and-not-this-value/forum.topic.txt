Text: Hey there!
I've been stuck at this problem for an hour, can anyone help me?

How can i get all the pages that don't have a certain value?
For example:

	<?php echo $allthechildren->filterBy('letter', 'A')->count() ?>

I want the number of all the pages with other values (B, C, Dâ€¦).
How do I do this?
