Text: Hi all!

I’ve been testing out [Picturefill 2.0](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) and it works great so far. I was wondering if it is possible to integrate it with Kirby into a template. 

I'm working on a couple of pages which each have multiple images. These images all have multiple versions (dimensions) so that Picturefill can do its thing.

If the pages only had one image, it would be fairly easy. But I have no idea where to start looking to make Kirby loop through all the images-sets and create the appropriate <code>figure</code> + <code>picture</code> for each one of them.

The final output should look something like in this Gist:

Is this possible at the moment?
Thanks for any help and pointers! 

P.S. I’ve looked at a couple Kirby-plugins for Picturefill like [this one](http://getkirby.com/forum/extensions/topic:1247/), but none that worked for me.
