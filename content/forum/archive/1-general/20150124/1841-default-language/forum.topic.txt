Text: In ```config.php```, I'm trying to set the default language in a multilingual project via

```c::set('lang.default', 'de');```

However, it does not have the desired effect, at least not on my local nor on my preview machine. The language still switches to ```en```.

I've also tried

```c::set('language.default', 'de');```

same outcome.

Any idea?

Thx!
