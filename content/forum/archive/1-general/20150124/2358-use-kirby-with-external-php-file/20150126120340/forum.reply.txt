Text: Okay guys!
I solved my own problem with this code:

*** Method 1 ***
```
<?php
require_once "kirby/toolkit/vendors/yaml/yaml.php";              // Kirby's built-in YAML parser based from Spyc
$Data = spyc_load_file('content/site.txt');              // loads the file to be parsed by this parser
echo $Data['Title'];              // outputs      "Kirby Starter Kit"
?>
```
Method 1 parses the site.txt file directly to get values.

*** Method 2 (RECOMMENDED) ***
```
<?php
define('DS', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);

// load kirby
require(DIR . DS . 'kirby' . DS . 'bootstrap.php');

$kirby = kirby();
$site = $kirby->site();
?>
```
Method 2 uses kirby's syntax to get the value. This is an official answer from Bastian, this is why it's recommended, however, you can use either of the two.

All the best,
