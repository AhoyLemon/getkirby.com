Text: Haven't tested it, but something like this should work:

I assume that it's the uid that you get when you select the page? Of not, you need to adjust the code below .
```php
$featureUID = page('projects')->featured(); 
$featuredProject = $page('projects')->children()->visible()->findBy('uid', $featureUID);
```
