Text: Hey everyone,

I want to display a single featured project on my home.php
On my projects-site (in the panel) I want to choose the featured project out of an select field. The select-field is working a give me a complete list of visible-childrens. 

But how can I output the chosen project on my home.php?

This is my current code:
````
<?php foreach(page('projects')->children()->category() as $project): ?>
<figure class="header-intro-img">
<?php if($image = $project->images()->sortBy('sort', 'asc')->first()): ?>
 <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo $project->title()->html() ?>">
<?php endif ?>
</figure>
<?php endforeach ?>
````

Can someone help me :)?
Thank You
