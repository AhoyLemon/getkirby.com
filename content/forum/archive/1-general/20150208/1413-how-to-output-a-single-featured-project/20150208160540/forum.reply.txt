Text: In site.txt (for instance) add a "Featured" field and put the name of the project you want to feature. In home.php (or in your projects.php snippet, whatever fits your aiming) do:

```
<?php foreach($page('projects')->children() as $project): ?>
<?php if($project->uid() == $site->featured()): ?>

<Insert your code for featured project display here>

<?php endif ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

In order to change which project is currently featured simply change the "Featured" field in site.txt.

Hope this helps.
