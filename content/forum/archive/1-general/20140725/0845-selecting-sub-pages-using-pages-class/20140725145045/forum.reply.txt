Text: As far as I know, there is no $page->find() but only $pages->find() and this command will find any page no matter how deep it is nested. It returns a single page object if you pass only one URI as argument or several objects if you pass several URIs.

From the Cheat-Sheet:

pages->find($uri, [$anotherUri])
finds a subpage by uri.
returns either a single page object, a set
of pages if you pass more than one uris or
false if nothing has been found. you can go
down the entire tree by using a uri path:
“projects/project-1/subpage” etc.
