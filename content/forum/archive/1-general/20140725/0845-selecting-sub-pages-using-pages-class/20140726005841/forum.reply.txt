Text: Thank you for your reply...yeah the first $page was a typo...should have been

    $pages->find('some-page');

Anyways...I still can not get the $pages->() method to return a nested page...Here is my partial page structure...

-> Home
-> About
-> Services
-> Portfolio
---> Web-Design
---> Photography
-> Contact

The "Web-Design" and the "Photography" pages are nested under the "Portfolio page.

Below is the code I run in a template file to try and select the 'Web Design' page...

    <?php
    
    $aNestedPage = $pages->find('Web-Design');

    // This outputs a php error saying..
    // "member function title() on a non-object"
    echo $aNestedPage->title();

    // If I then comment out the above echo and run a PHP var dump...
    var_dump($aNestedPage);
    // I get this output...
    // "boolean false"    

    // If I than do a find on a root level page than all is good...
    $aRootLevelPage = $pages->find('Portfolio');

    // echoing the page title of the root level page works as expected...
    echo $aRootLevelPage->title();

    // To get to the children of the page I have to call the 
    // children method...which the 'web-design' page is a child 
    // of the 'portfolio' page...
    $childrenOfPortfolio = $aRootLevelPage->children();

    // This outputs the urls of the child pages or the portfolio page 
    echo $childrenOfPortfolio;

    // If I then do a find on the set of child pages I can get the
    // 'web-design' page which is a direct child of the portfolio
    // page...
    $webDesignPage = $childrenOfPortfolio->find('web-design');

    // I can now echo out the title of the 'web-design' page
    // without errors...
    echo $webDesignPage->title();

    ?>

The above code is what I had to do to get to the nested page...has anyone else come across this?...Am I doing something incorrect?

According to the above reply the $pages->find() method should any and all pages no matter how far nested they are...but I have not found this to be the case..

Again any help is greatly appreciated...despite this I am loving Kirby...great CMS...
