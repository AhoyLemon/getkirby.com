Text: Hello:

I am at the relatively early stages of the Kirby learning process...so probably a newbie question...anyways I was trying to select a page which was nested two levels deep using... 

    $somePage = $page->find('some-page');

...and noticed this only worked on the main root level pages...In my testing in order to get it to find a nested page I had to do multiple steps...

    $somePage = $page->find('some-page');
    $someNestedPages = $somePage->children();
    $theNestedPage = $someNestedPages->find('the-nested-page');

...I also noticed that $pages->findByUID('some-page') returned a "pages" object and not a "page" object ...Is this correct...

I feel like I should just be able to find any page anywhere on the site using some sort of "find" method and it would return a single page element...

I am new to Kirby and I like it...just want to make sure I am not missing something...

Any help is greatly appreciated...

Thanks,

Michael
