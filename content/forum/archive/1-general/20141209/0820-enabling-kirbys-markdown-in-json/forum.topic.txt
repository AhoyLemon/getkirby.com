I have created a live search with JSON: 

```
$data = $pages->index();
$json = array();

foreach($data as $article) {

  $json[] = array(
    'url'   => (string)$article->url(),
    'title' => (string)$article->title(),
    'text'  => (string)$article->text(),
  );

}

echo json_encode($json);
```
It works fine, makes json file etc. But when im searching this information it doesnt use Markdown with it, so it shows markdown as it is like # marks and all. Would it be possible to enable it in json? or should i just write the pages with html?
