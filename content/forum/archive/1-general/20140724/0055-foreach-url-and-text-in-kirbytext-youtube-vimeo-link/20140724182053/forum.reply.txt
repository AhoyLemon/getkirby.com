Text: Using the youtube kirbytext tag will generate the standard youtube embed I believe, so you may want to use something different if that's not what you're going for. That being said, there are a couple of easy ways to go about this if you're not using the kirbytext youtube embed.

1. Make each video a "subpage" with basically two fields: text and link. Then loop through them as if they were subpages and build a list of them. You never have to actually link to the subpages.

2. Use YAML in your text field http://getkirby.com/blog/structured-field-content

**Edit:** Apparently I had this page open for awhile before commenting, so my answer is superfluous. Didn't see the others. :-)
