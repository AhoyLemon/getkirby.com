Text: Your "portfolio/projekte" and "portfolio/werdegang" are only one page each, so the foreach-loop doesn't make sense. I don't know your folder structure, but you probably have to get the children of both of these pages and then in the next loop, the children of those children, i.e. for the first loop:

```php
<?php foreach($pages->find('portfolio/projekte')->children()->visible() as $projects): ?>
...
```

And the same for "werdegang". If this doesn't help, pls. post your folder structure.
