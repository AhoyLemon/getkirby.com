Text: Hello,
as stated above, apparently when you let process kirbytext a vimeo url, kirby automatically wraps it with a figure tag.

Per se it's okay, but since I'd like to put inside the figure tag a figcaption,  now I cannot do it.

Is there a way to have more granularity about this behaviour?


Thank you all,
Andr√©
