Text: I have a search page in `content/search/search.md` and a corresponding template `site/templates/search.php`. I have several content pages:
```
content/01-articles/articles.md
content/02-snips/snips.md
content/03-find/find.md
content/04-about/about.md
content/article/01-something/article.md
content/article/02-something-else/article.md
content/snip/01-something/snip.md
content/snip/02-something-else/snip.md
```

I am trying to build a search that pulls its results from `content/article/` and `content/snip/`. But I do not seem to be able to get there. I tried a site wide search, such as:
```php
    $results = $site->search($query, array('words' => true))
              ->visible()
              ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
              ->paginate(10);
```
But how can I exclude pages I do not want - or - include pages that I want?

I also tried:
```php
    $results = page('article')
             ->search($query, array('words' => true))
             ->visible()->sortBy('date', 'desc')
              ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
              ->paginate(10);
```
I works well but only shows `content/article/` (as expected). If I specify multiple pages such  as `page('article','snip')` it fails to show anything. I also tried a slightly different syntax such as `$pages->find('article','snip')` or `$page->find('article','snip')`, neither returns any results. However, specifying just article or snip works fine.

Any thoughts on how I can search specific pages only?

Thanks
