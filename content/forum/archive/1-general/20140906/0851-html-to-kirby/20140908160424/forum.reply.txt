Text: Nearly all the examples of "cool kirby tricks" focus on a POV of a blog developer. There's some great (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/add-pagination-to-your-blog text: pagination) tutorials. 

There's also a starter (link: http://sashtown.de/baseblog-2-0 text: blog theme) developed by Sascha. That link was for the 2.0 version, but I'm sure there's a link on his page somewhere for 1.0 version if you intend to use the stable kirby version until 2.0 is out of beta. You can look at his template files for inspiration for your own blog.
