Text: I have used SiteLok (Vibralogix) and like it for non-Kirby panel, once-published site management. If I enter the magic require_once code to find/initialize the Sitelok script in Kirby's index.php, all is fine, but I do not want to block the public from the home (and many other pages). However, if I enter the SiteLok require_once code above the DOCTYPE of any Kirby template, I end up with a blank output page in the browser.

I don't understand why Kirby dislikes processing php in that context? Hopefully, I am missing the obvious. This is extremely important for the site under development and I will be very grateful for any tips.
