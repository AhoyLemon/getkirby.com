Text: Hi there

I’ve updated my server to PHP 5.6 and know my variables will lose value between snippets…

Example.

file1.php

   $a = 1;

file2.php

   snippet('file1.php');
   echo "A value is " . $a;

What I get is

   A value is

I've been looking for an answer for real long now but can't figure out what is going on.

Please advise.
