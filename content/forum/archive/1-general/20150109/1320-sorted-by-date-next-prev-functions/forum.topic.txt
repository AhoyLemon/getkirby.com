Text: Hello!

I so i have some projects sorted and shown by date and i use just flaging for visibility not numbering:

0-albatrosproject
0-betaproject


On the project page i would like to have prev/next switcher navigation but of course the next() and prev() or num() functions have no idea about the sorting i use in the above folder so they use alphabetical sorting instead of going according to date as i want it.

I asume i need to sort the collection that those functions use before but i have no idea how to do it.

Isnt there some sort of way how to sort posts and projects by date implicitly everywhere?

Thanks very much.
