Text: Thank you for your answer!

I probably havent explained it well. 

I need to pass the ordering context to the child so i can use 
$page->prev() and $page->next()
to get next and previous pages according to sorting ive made in page above (projects) which are sorted by date not by naming of the folders.

I suppose i could figure it out if i could find the next() and prev() functions source code but i cant find it.

I wanted to use the core functions but i probably have to pass the whole sorted collection to the child and make my own function for prev/next buttons. PITTY
