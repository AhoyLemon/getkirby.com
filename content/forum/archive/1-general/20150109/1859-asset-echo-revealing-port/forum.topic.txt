Text: Hi,

Server setup: Linode; Apache; PHP5; Kirby :)

I've setup Kirby without issue, and all is well except for when I view my site in source. The various `echo css( / url(` functions are echoing my URL _and_ port, e.g. mydomain.com:80/assets/css/main.css. The port is otherwise stripped from my URL, and when I navigate to an asset location directly. Any ideas why it's showing in source?

Cheers!
