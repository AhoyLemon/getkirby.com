Text: So, it's been quite a while since I made something in Kirby and I'm no expert; however I've been readings the docs. I need to create a mini-site for private per-client authenticated download pages, and in the section on Authentication it seems I can [create user roles that don't have panel access](http://getkirby.com/docs/solutions/authentication#user-management) (let's say such a user's shortname is `client-a`); and from the [Routing section](http://getkirby.com/docs/toolkit/routing#creating-routing-filters) I gather I should be able to direct such users to a path which is—for example—equivalent to their username e.g. `domain.name/client-a`.  

Does this sound feasible?

The second step would be to [combine this with Dropbox syncing](http://getkirby.com/docs/solutions/dropbox), so that the solution would consist of creating client accounts in the panel and dropping files in to equivalently named folders in the dropbox: thus when clients log in they see a listing of the files meant for them.

Does anyone have any cautions, qualifications, or objections to this logic? All feedback appreciated.
