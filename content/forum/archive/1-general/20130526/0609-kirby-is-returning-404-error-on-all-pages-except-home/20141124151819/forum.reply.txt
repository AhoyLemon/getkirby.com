Text: Thanks for posting your solution, @5w. I was having the same issue, only it was affecting my local machine. I'm a newbie to MAMP and setting up virtual hosts, so I'm posting my steps here in case it's helpful to fellow MAMP/virtual host newbies.

**To get virtual hosts working using MAMP 3.0.7.3** (so I can access my local dev site using something like "mysite.dev" instead of "localhost/mysite" (so URLs can all be absolute, etc.), here's what I did (following steps posted on various blogs and @5w's solution above):

**1. [Install MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)**, of course.

**2. Set up routing for your virtual hostname**: Open `/private/etc/hosts` in a text editor and add a line `127.0.0.1 mysite.dev` just under the `127.0.0.1 localhost` line.

**3. Configure MAMP to route your virtual hostname to your local development directory**: Open `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf` and change the two “dummy” <Virtual Host> configurations at the bottom to:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs"
        ServerName localhost
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "/path/to/your/local/dev/directory"
        ServerName mysite.dev
    </VirtualHost>

**4. Set MAMP to allow virtual hosts, and make sure mod_rewrite works correctly**: Open `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf` and find the following lines:

    # Virtual hosts
    # Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Un-comment the Include line to turn on virtual host support. In the same file, per @5w’s instructions, add the following to the bottom of the file to make sure Kirby’s clean URLs will work properly:

    <Directory "/path/to/your/local/dev/directory">
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
      AllowOverride All
      Order allow,deny
      allow from all
    </Directory>

[Note that you can use your dev site’s parent directory above so you don’t have to set this up for each virtual host individually in the future.]

**5. Change MAMP to use port 80**: The virtual hosts configured in step 3 use port 80, so you’ll need to make sure MAMP’s Apache server is using port 80. Launch MAMP, open the Preferences, click Ports, and switch the Apache port from the default 8888 to 80. Hit OK.

**6. Restart Apache**: If MAMP had already started the servers, click Stop Servers, wait a sec, then click Start Servers. 

Your virtual host should now be working, and Kirby’s pretty URLs should work properly now! (If I got anything wrong above, please let me know here or on Twitter: @_tinymachine.)
