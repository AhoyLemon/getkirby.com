Text: Hi there,

I have skimmed over this thread and a few others — trying to fix my routing situation to no avail. 

I have installed Kirby 2.0 along with the new .htaccess.

1. I have this ```c::set('rewrite', false); ``` in my config file. 
2. I attempted to include RewriteBase /, but that brought me to a 404 again.
Right now, I am seeing an error message calling to a ```member function html() on a non-object``` in my header.php file referencing line 8 where the ```<title>``` tag is.

I have had issues in the past with routing — and had to settle with having /index.php in my URL. I feel like I am trying every method there is, but am still missing something. I am a PHP newbie so I am not sure how to check whether my PHP is the latest version. How might I fix this in my domain control panel (if at all)? Any help would be much appreciated.
