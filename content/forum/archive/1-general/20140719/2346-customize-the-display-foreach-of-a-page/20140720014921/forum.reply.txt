Text: Personally, the way I would have done this is like so:

        <?php $articles = $pages->findByUID('folio')->children()->visible()->limit(4); ?>
        <?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>

            <div class="<?php echo $article->width() ?>">
                <ul>
                    <?php if($article->hasImages()): ?>
                    <li><img src="<?php echo $article->images()->first()->url() ?>" /></li>
                    <?php endif ?>
                </ul>                        
            </div>

        <?php endforeach ?>

Blueprint for the Item in the Panel

          width: 
            label: Image Size
            type: radio
            options:
               grid third:  Small
               grid full:  Large
               default: grid third

My CSS would be as follows 

          .grid.third {
               width: 400px;
          }
          .grid.full {
               width: 1200px;
          }

In this example I'm displaying 4 items just as your example was, I have added a variable to the div class which will be set in the Panel. This way you could have two set options (large Item and Regular item) and use CSS to set the first item to be the large size.

Going off what your's is doing I believe this will product the same result but a lot simpler. It will allow you to change the items order quite quickly too.

There may be an easier way?
