Text: I do know CSS and yet I think this new figure element should be optional. Figure doesnt always have to have an image and an image can be part of the main content while figure represents self-contained content. See (link: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element text: this)

Something like: 

```kirbytext
( image: x.jpg)
```
and
```
 (figure: x.jpg)
```
 might be better.
