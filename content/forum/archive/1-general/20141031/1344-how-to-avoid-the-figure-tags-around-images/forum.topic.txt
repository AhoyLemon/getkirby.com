Text: With Kirby v1 I would use something like:


( image: assets/images/some_image.jpg link: some_image  alt:some_image ) ( image: assets/images/another_image.jpg link: another_image alt:another_image ) ( image: assets/images/yet_another_image.jpg link:yet_another_image alt:yet_another_image ) 


to have 3 images in a row.  Now Kirby 2(.0.2) adds **figure** tags around these images, which results them in being one in a row, which is not desired. 

Is there any way to get the old behavior? Note that the images don't change often, so it makes much more sense to have them hard-coded, rather than somehow enumerate and go through them.


Edit: note that I added artificial space between the opening parentheses and **image** to avoid the forum formatting. Even when quoting this as code, it gets formatted with the undesired **figure** tag like this:

```
(image: assets/images/some_image.jpg link: some_image  alt:some_image) (image: assets/images/another_image.jpg link: another_image alt:another_image) (image: assets/images/yet_another_image.jpg link:yet_another_image alt:yet_another_image) 
```
