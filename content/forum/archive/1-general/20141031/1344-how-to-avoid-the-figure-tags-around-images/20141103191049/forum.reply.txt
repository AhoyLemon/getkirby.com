Text: I submitted a bug/suggestion to make this optional and it looks like he marked it as a milestone for future release.

It bugged me as well, as I had to start doubling up CSS for .class and .class img to retain the exact behavior I had before.

I also used jquery to strip all <p> tags that surrounded <img> tags automatically prior to this change.
