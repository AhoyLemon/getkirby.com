Text: You can easily change that. Just copy the image tag, put in into site/tags and strip out the figure stuff  and create a new tag called figure and make that behave the way you want ...

However, the old image tag (Kirby 1) always generated p-tags around the image tag, that's maybe the reason why this has been changed. In many cases you don't want p-tags around your images and then you have to get rid of them again.
