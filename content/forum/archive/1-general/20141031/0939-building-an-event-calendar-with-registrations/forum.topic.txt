I'm currently building an event calendar for one of my clients. For some of those events there is a registration required. Setting up a form and a Kirby controller is no problem and at the moment I'm sending all the data via email. 

Now I'm wondering whether to save all those data in Kirby. Either as subpages or as structured data. But my big question is: How can I access all those registrations from the panel and give my client a good overview for each event? Are there any possibilities to hook into the panel and for example create a table view that can be printed?

Has someone tried any equal before? 

I'm very thankful for some ideas! Thanks!
