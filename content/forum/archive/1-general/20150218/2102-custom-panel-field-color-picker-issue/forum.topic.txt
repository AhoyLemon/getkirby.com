Text: I'm trying to create a custom panel field as a color picker. I've selected the JQuery plugin, (link: http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ text: Spectrum), as the picker of choice as it seems to allow a great deal of customization.

I can't seem to get this to work in Kirby though. I'm wondering if it's due to the way the MVC is set up. It doesn't seem to be triggering on the element I've set it to.

The assets are located in site/fields/color/assets/js/ ...../css directories. The examples I've seen seemed to indicate this was correct. The CSS file loads fine and changes are made visible, and the JS appears to load into the page's source code.

site/fields/color/color.php

```
<?php

class ColorField extends InputField {

  static public $assets = array(
    'js' => array(
      'spectrum.js',
      'spectrum.settings.js'
    ),
    'css' => array(
      'spectrum.css'
    )
  );

  public function input() {
    $input = parent::input();
    $input->attr('type', 'text');
    $input->addClass('colorpicker');
    return $input;
  }

}
```


site/fields/color/assets/js/spectrum.settings.js

```
$(document).ready(function() {
   $(".colorpicker").spectrum({
      color: "#f00"
   });
});
```


Even when I change the settings file to something like css('background','blue') it doesn't appear to work. Which leads me to believe even with the document.ready() it's not deferring the loading until after the view loads, or the view isn't accessible for some reason.



Any ideas?
