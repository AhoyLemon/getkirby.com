Text: Hello! I am newish to PHP and Kirby and wanted to see if anyone had any ideas on how to tackle my problem. 

I'm working on a grid-style portfolio site for a client. On the homepage I fetch the list of projects and create blocks on the grid, each showing the featured image (plugin found here: https://github.com/iandoe/kirbycms-panel-imagepicker-field). The size and location of each block is important, and the client does not want the images to be cropped or distorted, so I think using something like fitWidth would not be appropriate for what I want because I'm afraid it will crop the height.

Is there a way to return the list of projects, somehow filtered by landscape or portrait? The other way I thought about doing this was to have a radio button with Landscape and Portrait in Kirby Panel that she could select, but wanted to see if there was another way around this. 

Any help would be much appreciated! Many thanks.
