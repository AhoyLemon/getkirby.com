Text: Not sure if I'm facing a bug but in Kirby 2.0.4 and previous when kirbytext() is invoked to render a textarea from the Panel where there is an ol list such as:
````
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
4. Item four
````
The rendered html is displayed in Firefox like this : 
````
1. Item one
1. Item two
1. Item three
1. Item four
````
Whereas the render is okay with Webkit browsers.

Anyone can confirm this behaviour / bug ? Not shown in github issues as far as I know.
