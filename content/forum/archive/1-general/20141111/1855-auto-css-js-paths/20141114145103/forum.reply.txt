Text: @texnixe, 

Thanks for your response. I am familiar with those pages. The old docs had information on them about overriding the default location of "auto files".

So if I didn't want them to be in "/assets/css/templates" I was able to set an option in the config file.

Something like:  c::set('autocss.folder','/assets/styles/css/templates')

I'm not sure if this option was deprecated or just left out of the auto css/js docs or the site options doc. I've tried based on memory to figure out what it might be but can't for the life of me get it to work.
