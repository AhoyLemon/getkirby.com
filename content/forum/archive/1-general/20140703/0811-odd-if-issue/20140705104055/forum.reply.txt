Text: > only if the page has images with a certain keyword

Do you mean filter by a specific tag/category? How can you attach a tag/category to an image? It is my understanding that you can only attach tags/categories to pages. Now, if you want to show a piece of text based on the page tag/category, that is possible.

But I don't believe it is your code. According to Bastian, [this is not possible yet](http://getkirby.com/blog/tagcloud#comment-774709771).

However, tweet (@getkirby) Bastian to double-check.
