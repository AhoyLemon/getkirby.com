Text: Hey there,

I am running a multilang site with Kirby 1 and want to update it to version 2.  Now I do have some problems with my multilang-setup. On my pageheader I have a nav to switch between the two languages. What I do currently: I do only display a link to the english translation if such a translation is available. I am doing this by looking for the markdown file of the specific language: https://github.com/mauricerenck/code-samples/blob/master/kirby-multilang/lang_switch.php

I changed to code to match the new kirby2 language-methods. But I don't get it running. Whenever I try to search for a markdown file, I do not get any results. 

Is there a way to search for the markdown-files using kirby, or do I have to use "plain" php?

Or is there a way to see if translations are available? That might be the best solution, like: $page->getTranslations() to get a list of all translations.

Thanks in advance.
