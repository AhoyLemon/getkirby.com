Text: Hey guys... I'm trying to show the content of one parent page in another pages.

Something like: the  Contact Page shows some content from the about page.

How can I do it? I could do with a child page, as an example... to show the title:
<?php foreach(page('cardapio')->children()->visible()->limit(3) as $prato): ?>

<?php echo html($prato->title()) ?>

<?php endforeach ?>

It worked fine.

Is there any way to get the content from a parent page and not from its children pages?

Thanks in advance.
