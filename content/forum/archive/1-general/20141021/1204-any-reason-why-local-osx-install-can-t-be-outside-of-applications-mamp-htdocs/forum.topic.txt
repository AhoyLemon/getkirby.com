Text: When I edited my MAMP document root to `/path/to/my/site`, I would receive an error in the browser that the location was unavailable. It appears Kirby only works with OSX MAMP when placed inside of MAMP's `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/` directory.

Just wondering what the underlying reason is purely out of curiosity.

Thanks!
