Text: Not the easy way (because currently I think there is none implemented), but this works:

In your template:

```
$categoriesMap = array(
  '01' => 'string_1',
  '02' => 'string_2',
  '03' => 'string_3'
);
```

Later in the  template:
```
<?php
  foreach ($page->categories()->split() as $category):
    echo $categoriesMap[trim($category)];
  endforeach;
?>
```
