Text: As far as I could see, at least part of the old docs are available in this repo: https://github.com/aparida/getkirby.com. So it should be easy to take out the content folder and put it into a local kirby install. Or put a kirby folder inside and get it to run (don't know what version that is though)

I think it would be helpful if Bastian would put the original documentation of the website into a K1 repo for reference ...
