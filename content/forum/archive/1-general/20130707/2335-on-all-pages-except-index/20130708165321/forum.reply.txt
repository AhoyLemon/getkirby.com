Text: Thank you,

Your response led me to realize that although I have a .htaccess file, it was not getting copied over when I moved the contents of the directory over to my server using Coda 2. Therefore my old .htaccess file wasn't getting overwritten by the new one provided by Kirby.

Thanks for asking the right questions, and I'm glad the solution ended up being so simple.
