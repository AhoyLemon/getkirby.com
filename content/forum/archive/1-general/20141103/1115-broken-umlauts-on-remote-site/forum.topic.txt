Text: Hi there,

I currently have a problem with following snippet on my remote testing site (uberspace)

```
<?php echo strftime('%d. %B %Y', strtotime($ausstellung->start()));?>
```

My local MAMP is printing the name of the month (e.g. MÃ¤rz) properly, but the remote site replaces the umlaut with this beautiful broken-char-question-mark-thingy.

I don't think, that this is a bug in Kirby, but at the moment I don't have a clue where to kick against the code or the php config to fix this. Umlauts in Kirbytext are working.
