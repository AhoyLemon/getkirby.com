Text: I would like to protect every pages of a website with a login / password, like the `globale firewall`method described here: http://getkirby.com/blog/frontend-authentication. 

When a user tries access a page, if is not logged-in he is not redirected but he sees a login form. 

Do you know how to achieve this with kirby 2 ? 

thanks
