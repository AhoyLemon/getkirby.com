The header image is a repeating 600x600 px square, but I want to replace it with a wide, automatically resizing image (like a panorama or similar). The current CSS styling is:

```
#header { 
	width: 100%;
	color: #fff;
	background: #1f2428 url('../images/bg.jpg') repeat top center;
	position: relative;
	text-align: center;
}

```

If I change bg.jpg to my ideal image, how do I get the image to correctly resize and keep it's original proportions?

So far this has worked, but is still a bit weird. The page is subtly (but noticeably) laggy when scrolling:

```
#header { 
	color: #fff;
	background: #1f2428 url('../images/bg.jpg') top center;
	background-size: 100%;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;

	position: relative;
	text-align: center;
}
```

How do I do this in a cleaner manner?
