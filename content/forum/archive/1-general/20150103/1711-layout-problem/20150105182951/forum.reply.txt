Text: It looks like this line may be your culprit, where you're echoing the img src.

	<?php echo $page->children()->sortBy('publication','desc')->nth($k)->image()->url(); ?>


image() has no value out of the box I would assume.
images() is the collection of all images, but even that needs further clarification.

If you want the first image it finds displayed try:

	<?php echo $page->children()->sortBy('publication','desc')->nth($k)->images()->first()->url(); ?>

Or if each is a thumbnail with a specific name (such as cover.jpg) try:

	<?php echo $page->children()->sortBy('publication','desc')->nth($k)->images()->find('cover.jpg')->url(); ?>
