Text: I want to get my h2 muted, if there are no things to be displayed, but somehow i seem to be not able to get it done :(

```
<h2>Heading</h2>
<ul id="things">
<?php foreach($page->things()->split(',') as $tag): ?>
<li><?php echo $tag ?></li>
<?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```

i suppose, i will need an if statement?
