Text: Sooo, I'm not sure whether it's a single problem acting two different ways or two distinct problems.

First symptom: when working online (not on local server), the panel "crashes" the moment I try to access / edit any file (image)'s metadata. "Crashes" as in, I get a white / light gray window with absolutely nothing visible even though the inspector (Ctrl / Cmd + U) gives me an appearance of content. Refreshing doesn't seem to work, and actually if I step back the crash "persists" until I refresh on a page that isn't a file's page.

Second symptom: when working offline (so, on my local server), the panel crashes don't happen anymore but some of the images don't get thumbnails or preview. Emptying the thumbs folder to force Kirby to recreate the thumbs doesn't work - Kirby just recreates the exact same thumbs, the "excluded" images remain the same. I've been unable to locate the criteria on which the images are "included" or "excluded" - it doesn't seem to happen in the metadata, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the image size... On the other hand, excluded images also don't have a preview, maybe there's a link there? Is there a way to force the panel to rebuild every single preview?

I'm thinking this may have something to do with data the panel stores (I'm not sure where) about the location of files. I've been moving files (and their attached metadata) around a lot between folders to try and reach a layout I like. Shouldn't cause problems from my understanding but then, can't think of any other reason.

So yeah, hoping I can get a little help here.

Cheers!
