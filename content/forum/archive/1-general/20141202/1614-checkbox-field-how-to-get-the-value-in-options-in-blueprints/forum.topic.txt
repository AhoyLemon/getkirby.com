Text: Hi all,

I'd like to know if there is a way to get the "value" (in blueprints file) of the options of a checkbox field.

Example :

```
fields:
  categories:
    label: Categories
    type: checkboxes
    options:
      modernart: Modern Art
      photography: Photography
```

How to get "Modern Art" instead of "modernart"?

```
<?php
$page->categories()->html()
?>
```

Thanks !
