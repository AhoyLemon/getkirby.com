Text: The first part of the options is the value for categories that goes into the text file, the second part is what is displayed to the user.

So if you want the value to be "Modern Art", your blueprint should be like this:

```
fields:
  categories:
    label: Categories
    type: checkboxes
    options:
      Modern Art: Modern Art
      Photography: Photography
```
