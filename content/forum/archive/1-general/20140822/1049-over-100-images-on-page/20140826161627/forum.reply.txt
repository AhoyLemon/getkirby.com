Text: I thinking this isn't a bug from KirbyCMS but is a PHP configuration. The standard configuration is limited to 99 array passed via GET/POST, then if you can: first dont show over 99 images in the same page, for me its crazy xD, then second you can try before lost your mind using a pagination for validate if all code inside your project it's working fine, of corse if you can edit php configuration check the 99 value inside your php.ini then edit to 999 and check if working.

Please report your solution/fix. Thanks.
