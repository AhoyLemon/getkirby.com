Text: Yeah all of that or you can simply stop listening to people who doesn't know what are they talking about and put this in your .htaccess

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yourdomain\.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.+\.(png|jpg|gif|jpe?g))$ http://yourCDNURL.com/$1 [L,R=301]

that way all your image files are going to be loaded from your CDN.
