Text: Hello, 

i'm trying to organise the files of my home folder into different sub-foders, one for each section of the homepage. 

I read the tutorial about the one-pager, but i'm not trying to loop through all the subfolders, instead i'm trying to get into a specific subfolder. 

For example i want to put all the images of my slider into the home/0X-slider/ folder. How can i reach those images from my slider.php snippet? 

I don't understand how i can use the $pages->find variable. 

Thank you for your work,
