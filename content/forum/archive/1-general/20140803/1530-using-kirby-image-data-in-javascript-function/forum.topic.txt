Text: I am trying out Kirby as a CMS for a website where the client can upload images by FTP into a kirby folder.

I use javascript mainly to build the website (I'm not knowledgable about PHP) so I was wondering how to get the $Page->$Images() and all its contents (image urls, etc.) as a javascript variable?

As a side question, why does PHP return 1 for the image count even if there are lots of images?

$arraytest = $page->images();
// this displays 1 even when there are more images
echo 'We have ' . count($arraytest) . " images";
