Text: Hi there

I want to show all invisible pages in the /content folder, independent if they are in one subfolder or another.

Example:

.. content/
... invisible1
... folder1/
.... invisible2
.... folder2/
..... invisible3

I would like all of the invisible pages above to be displayed.

But when I do my foreach I can only get specific levels to appear and as invisible1 is in a different level than invisible2, I can't get both to be displayed.

Thanks in advance for your help!
