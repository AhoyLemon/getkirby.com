Text: Just don't give ```$page->url()``` a parameter. From the docs:
> Returns the full URL of the page

See (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/page/url).

Use the following for your URL instead: ```$page->url() . '/tag:' . $tag```, and remove the if/else statement, then it should work.
