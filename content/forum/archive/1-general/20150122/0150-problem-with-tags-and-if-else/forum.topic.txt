Text: I've got a site that is hosting a directory of businesses divided into two main Content folders: Restaurants and Shopping. They both have children for each business. There are two directory pages I created to show complete listings of the children (one for Restaurants, one for Shopping). That all works, but you needed backstory.

I wanted to implement Tags area so you could click to narrow your selection to, say, Pizza or Coffee or Whatever. The Tags are there, showing up and functional on one page, but not the other. This guy:

```
<a href="<?php echo $page->url('restaurants/tag:' . $tag)?>">
<li class="label"><?php echo html($tag) ?></li></a>
```

Is setting up each Tag as a link, like the docs suggested. However, when calling from the Shopping directory page, it's still giving me this **mydomain.com/restaurants/tag:whatever**. So the solution seemed to be an if/else statement:
 _If the Page called Restaurant is loaded, then use the above; else, use the Shopping code instead._ Here's the full code for this snippet:

```
<?php $tags = $page->children()->pluck('tags', ',', true); ?>

<ul class="tags">
	<?php foreach($tags as $tag): ?>

		<?php if(page != 'restaurants'): ?>
			<a href="<?php echo $page->url('restaurants/tag:' . $tag)?>">
			<li class="label"><?php echo html($tag) ?></li></a>

		<?php else: ?>
			<a href="<?php echo url('shopping/tag:' . $tag)?>">
			<li class="label"><?php echo html($tag) ?></li></a>

		<? endif ?>

	<?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```

Can anyone help me out? I cannot seem to get this to work. It makes sense in my head, but I am still very green to Kirby, so I could be off in my thought process. Thanks so much, you guys are an invaluable community here. Can't wait to share my site!
