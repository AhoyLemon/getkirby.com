Text: Yes, that sounds like  a lot of work, especially if you have hundreds of files, but unfortunately there is no way to extract that information out of the binary data of the picture;)

However, if you are using the panel, you can tell your blueprint that you want fields with the files and then you can enter  the captions etc. in the panel, which is probably less hassle then generating all the files.
