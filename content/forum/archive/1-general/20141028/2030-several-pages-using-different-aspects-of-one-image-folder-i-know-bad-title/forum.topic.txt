Text: Here's my idea:

Lets say I have a pool of images of … i don't know … cats (its the internet after all).
Now I want to have three pages. First one shows the cat pictures sorted in order of the different races. The second pages' sort-order is fur color. The third shows all in alphabetical order.

So I have one data source (the cat folder) and three different ways to present the data. 

How would I achieve this? I can't figure it out. Is there no easy way or am I just not seeing the obvious solution?
