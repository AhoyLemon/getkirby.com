Text: Stuck again here. I'm learning a ton from the Docs and the Forum, but sometimes I just get a little over my head. 

I have a simple 3 field YAML array called 'Featured' :

- name _(text field)_
- description _(text area)_
- relatedpage _(page field)_

I've already built the foreach loop to handle creating a list of Featured entries:

```
<ul>
  <?php $featureditems = yaml($page->featured()) ?>
  <?php foreach($featureditems as $featured): ?>
       <li class="item">
            <h2><?php echo $featured['name'] ?></h2>
            <p><?php echo $featured['description'] ?></p> 
            <a href="">Read More</a>
       </li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```

The problem comes when I'm trying to get that "Read More" anchor-tag to link out to each Featured relatedpage URI _(I've removed my horrid attempts in an effort to clean up the code for you)_. I have tried all that I can think of, it's the YAML and possible nested foreach loops that have confused me here. And syntax. Still learning syntax rights & wrongs lol.

Thank you for any help you've got!
