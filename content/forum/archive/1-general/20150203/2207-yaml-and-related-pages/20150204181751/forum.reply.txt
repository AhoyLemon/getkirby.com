Text: @texnixe  -- That almost works. It does give me the related page that was chosen in the YAML field in the Panel.... however, it inserts the current page into the URL before the related page address.

The page where these links reside is called "List". So when it returns the URL from "relatedpage", I get this:

```
www.mywebsite.com/list/(relatedpage parent)/(relatedpage child)
```

Problem is, that "relatedpage" is not a child of the "List" page.  Does that make sense?
Any ideas on how to leave out the current "List" page from the URL generation?

Thank you so much for looking at this!
