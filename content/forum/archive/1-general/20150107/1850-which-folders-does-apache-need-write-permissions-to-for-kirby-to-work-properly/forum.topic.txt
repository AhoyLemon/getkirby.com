Text: Tried logging in on a shared server via panel, and got: "The authentication token could not be stored." I could be wrong, but I think apache needs write access to some folders for kirby to properly work.

I figured the following folders apache needs write access to:
/content
/site/accounts

Are there any others? Alternatively, is there a different problem/solution?

Thanks!
