Text: You could use php string manipulation, e.g. via explode. Something like this should work (just make sure there is no other h1 tag in the template in between this code snippet and output of the title).



    <?php
        $text=kirbytext($page->text());
        $array = explode("</h1>", $text, 2);//replace h1 with correct header tag
        $title = $array[0];
        echo $title;
    ?>

You might want to test other php string commands.
