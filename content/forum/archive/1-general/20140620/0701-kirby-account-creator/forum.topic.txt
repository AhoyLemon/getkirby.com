Not 100% I'm posting this in the right place but...

After recently installing Kirby, I decided that it far too difficult to have to make your own .php files for each account. 

I quickly threw together a little web app that will create the files for you. You can check it out [here on GitHub](https://github.com/samjdavis13/kb-accounts) or play with it here [on my own site.](http://samjd.me/kb/)

Enjoy :D
