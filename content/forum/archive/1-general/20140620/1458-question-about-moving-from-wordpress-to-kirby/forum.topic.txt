Text: Hi,

I am thinking about moving my blogs to Kirby. Right now I am using Wordpress.
So far I found the wordpress exporter for Kirby which exported all my blogposts to text-files. But that's it.

Right now my URL-structure looks like this: sub.domain.net/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title/

Is there a tool to recreate in Kirby this URL-structure for my blog-posts when moving them? Is it even possible to work with such URLs in Kirby?
