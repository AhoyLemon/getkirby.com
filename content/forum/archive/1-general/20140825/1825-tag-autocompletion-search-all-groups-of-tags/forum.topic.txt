Text: Hello!

I have a tag cloud (I'm not using the tag cloud plugin, but visually tags appear and behave like a tag cloud), and in Kirby Panel,
I have it set up as 4 separate tag fields (tag_1,tag_2, etc.). The reason for this is because the client wants to control which tag shows up in which row in the tag cloud. 

I am using the Kirby autocomplete plugin, but I want to change the behavior so that it searches all tag fields, not just tag_1 for example. Currently if I have a tag called 'editorial' in the tag_1 field, if I started typing in 'editorial' in the tag_2 field, it would not show up. Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thank you!
