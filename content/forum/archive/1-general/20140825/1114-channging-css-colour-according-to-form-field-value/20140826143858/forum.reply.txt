Text: If I understand what you want to achieve correctly, there are at least two ways to go about this:

If there are only two colours, i.e. blue if a special tag and standard if the tag is absent, you could do this:

    <sup class="<?php if ($item->tag() == "other") {echo "blue"} ?>" ?><?php echo html($item->artist()) ?></sup>

If you want to have a different colour for each project that has a special tag, you could use the tag-content as class and then define the colour in the css:

    <sup class="<?php echo $item->tag() ?>" ?><?php echo html($item->artist()) ?></sup>

Of course, this only works if you have a field called "tag" in your text file that contains only one value. Otherwise, if there a several tags, you would have to create an array out of these tags and then check if the array contains a certain value (using `a::contains`)
