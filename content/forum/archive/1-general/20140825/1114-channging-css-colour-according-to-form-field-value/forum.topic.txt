Text: Hi,

Firstly, enjoying Kirby, flexible and (not too) minimal!

So I have a menu where every menu item is a $page/project. To every menu item I have attached a superscript that gives the project Author. 

So far so good, but I would also like the colour of the superscript to change according to a tag that i have defined as a field in the txt file. 

I'm struggling with this and got about this far:

<?php

<sup class="<?php if ($page->findBy('tag','other')){ echo "blue";} ?>"><?php echo html($item->artist()) ?></sup>

?>

Anyone able to help?
