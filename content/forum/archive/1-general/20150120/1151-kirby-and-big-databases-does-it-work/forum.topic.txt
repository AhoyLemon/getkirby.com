Text: Hello,
I am working on a new website for a project which will be very archive-like:
it's going to be a huge glossary of data of different kind, sort of big repository.

I am wondering, just to be sure and because I love kirby, if there will be any problem about it, or if in this case is still better to make use of a mysql database (meaning I'll have to use wordpress).

I remember this was a suggestion Bastian gave to someone before kirby 2 came out, so now I'm asking if things are different.
