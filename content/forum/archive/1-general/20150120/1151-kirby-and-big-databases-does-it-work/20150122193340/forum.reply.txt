Text: It does look like the toolkit doc has been fleshed out quite a bit in this area (which is great, because it was previously very bare), but it has actually had some great database helpers for awhile.

For most people, there isn't a reason to make this switch. I'm not sure where the performance using flat files vs databases becomes noticeable, and to which side the scale would tip.

Some reasons you might want a database..

If you have content that can be created or edited by the public on a live site, and the files exist on multiple servers for load balancing purposes (as I pointed out in my first post)..

If you wanted access to the same data tables from multiple services, not just a kirby site. An app with a subscription service may want to use one common user base for logging into the app as well as logging into their site to make changes.

If you utilize development and production environment/servers, but they have forums or comments you want to be accessible/identical on both.
