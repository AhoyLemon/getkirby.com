Text: I used Kirby 1.0 with a user database for restricted pages. The user base had to be identical across a load balancer with multiple production servers, leaving me unable to utilize the flat file system.

It worked fine for this as well as for tracking user certification test status and answers. I don't know if this is big enough to compare to your needs though. It all worked very well though and I loved Kirby's mysql helpers.

Its only gotten better in 2.0 from the looks of it.
