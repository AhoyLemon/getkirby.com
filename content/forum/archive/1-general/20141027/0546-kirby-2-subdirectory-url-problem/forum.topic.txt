Text: since moving to kirby 2 i have a problem with the subfolder showing in the url (which i didn't have with kirby 1)

i want to be able to call www.mysite.com and have it invisibly use the subdirectory

www.mysite.com/subdir 

but  i now the urls are of type

www.mysite.com/subdir/page1
instead of 
www.mysite.com/page1

changing the RewriteBase in .htaccess doesn't seem to do anything 
and neither does changing 
c::set('url', 'http://www.mysite.com'); 
c::set('subfolder', '/');
in config.php

anyone?
thanx
