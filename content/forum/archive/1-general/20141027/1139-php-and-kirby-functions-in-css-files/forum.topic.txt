Text: Hey,

I want to use kirby functions within my css file especially for things like urls but just changing the file to php and adding header type didn't do the job.

```
<?php
  header('Content-type: text/css');
  /*
    Hier werden Variablen und ggf.
    Algorithmen festgelegt.
  */
  
?>
```

Anyone can give me a hint how to do it?
