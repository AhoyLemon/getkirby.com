Text: I think the problem is probably due to the fact that you can't use `kirby() ...`.

What you can do, however, is this:

Define your variable:

```php
<?php
    header("Content-type: text/css");
    $url = "http://www.example.com/kirby-folder";
?>
```

Then for the background:

```css
body {
  background: url("<?php echo $url; ?>/assets/images/file.name") no-repeat;
}
```
