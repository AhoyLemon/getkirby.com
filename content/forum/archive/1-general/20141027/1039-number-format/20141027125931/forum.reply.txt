Text: The output in a Kirby template depends on the language settings, i.e. in a multi-lang setting (en/de), 

```php
<?php echo 1/2; ?>
```

will output 0,5 on a German page and 0.5 on an English page. I don`t know if this behaviour can be changed in the Kirby settings, though.

Other than that, you can use 

```php

<?php number_format($number); ?>

```

with different options to get the result you want.
