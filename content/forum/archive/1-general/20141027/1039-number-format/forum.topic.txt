Text: Within Kirby, numbers decimals are separated by a comma instead of a point...

```
// on a kirby template file
echo 1/2; // output: 	0,5

// on a php file outside Kirby (on the same server)
echo 1/2; // output: 	0.5
```

Does anyone know where this come from? Is it possible to reverse it?
