Text: Hey all,

I've got a few custom routes for my website and I'm having issues getting them working when I configure multi-language support.

I haven't found any examples of a multi-language website using routing, so could someone with some experience post an example of what needs doing in order for it to work please?

One of my routes (shown below) is generating the following error message:

```
    array(
        'pattern' => 'portal',
        'action' => function () {
            $site = site();
            $user = $site->user();

            if ($user !== false) {
                return go('vault/' . $user->username());
            }

            return page('portal');
        }
    )
```

```
Error

179      $content = $this->_content($this->site->language->code);

182      if($this->site->language->code != $this->site->defaultLanguage->code) {
183 
184        // fetch the default language content
```
