Text: What's the best way to determine the language set by the request? I'm currently looking at the HTTP Referer header for this information, but surely there is a better way?

```
$lang = '';
if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], '/ru') !== false) {
    $lang = 'ru';
    $site->visit('client-area', 'ru');
}
```

What's the best way to go to a page in the other language? I'm currently prepending the $lang variable to the url .

```
go($lang . '/client-area');
```

Thanks for the help so far!
