Text: I am building a Kirby 2 port of the [link: https://github.com/louiswalch/kirbycms-panel-imagepicker-field title: Panel Image Picker], but for some reason in my custom field class when I query page()->images() , it's only returning the first 2 images from the page. You can see from the screenshot that there are multiple images (yes if I click on them the detail page says it's an image) but the PHP debugging code only shows 2 items being looped over.

Screenshot:

Code:
````
if (page()->hasImages()) {

    foreach (page()->images() as $img) {

        $val  = $img->filename();

        a::show($val);

        $this->options[$val] = array(
            'name'      => $img->name(),
            'extension' => str::upper($img->extension()),
            'path'      => thumb($img, array('width' => 40, 'height' => 40), false)
        );

    }

}
