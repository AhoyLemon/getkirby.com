Text: Hello, 

i'm trying to make an accordion in multiple languages (italian, german, english). 

I'd like to have a different text file for each element of the accordion. The html i'll use for each element is this : 
`<h2 class="accordion-toggle">Blah</h2>`
`<div class="accordion-content">`
`blah blah` 
`</div>`

And the content of each element text file is this: 
`Title: Title here`----
`Text: text here`

So i'd like to loop through each text file and get from them my variables Title and Text through kirbitext(). Since my website will be in 3 languages, for each element there should be 3 files (en.txt, it.txt, de.txt). 
All these text files will be in a subfolder of the page which hosts the accordion.

How can i do? 

Thanks for your work and your help
