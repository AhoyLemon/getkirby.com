Text: Thanks for the quick reply. 
It works, but it's not what i'm trying to achieve. 

Now it loops through all the subfolders and echos the title of the first text file of each subfolder. 

Instead I want to loop through the many text files contained in 1 subfolder. Is it possible? Or should i create subfolders inside the subfolder? 

Here is the situation of my folders now: 

home
01-page
––page.txt
––01-slider
––02-accordion
––––accordionEl1.en.txt
––––accordionEl1.de.txt
––––accordionEl1.it.txt
––––accordionEl2.en.txt
––––accordionEl2.de.txt
––––accordionEl2.it.txt

and so on. I want to loop the many text files contained in the 02-accordion folder.
