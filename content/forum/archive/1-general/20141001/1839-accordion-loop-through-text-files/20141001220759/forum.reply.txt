Text: I don't think what you are trying to do is possible, You need to put each set of text files in separate subfolders.

Where do you want to put the accordions? On the home page? Or on a separate accordion page? The `$page->children` bit must be in relation to the page where you want to include it, depending on that you might want to use `$pages->find()->children()`or whatever is suitable to get the subfolders.
