Text: Is there a way in Kirby to filter posts with multiple tags. 

For exemple:
I loop trough all available tags using this to generate a link with each particular tag.  

```
<?php echo url('blog/tag:' . $tag)?>
```

Then i check  if there is a particular tag, lets say "red":

```
<?php
	//add filter for tags.
	if($tag = urldecode(param('tag'))){
  		$articles = $articles->filterBy('tags', $tag, ',');
	}
?>
```
Now i would like to do the same for a set of tags like "red", "blue", "yellow". So that Kirby shows all the posts related to one or more of those tags. Whats the way to go ?
