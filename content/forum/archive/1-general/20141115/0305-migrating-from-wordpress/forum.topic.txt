Text: Hi,

I've read a few posts on the forum about migrating from Wordpress to Kirby. One aspect I am not seeing answered:

What is the best tool to export Wordpress post to a structure that  is conducive to conversion to Kirby?

Even though I am using Wordpress, it is just a tool to provide my website. I am looking for a simple guide or guidance to a tool to get from Wordpress to Kirby without investing much time in researching Wordpress plugins and tools. I have too many posts to do it all manually but not that many posts that some manually fixing up will be a problem.

Thanks,
Adi
