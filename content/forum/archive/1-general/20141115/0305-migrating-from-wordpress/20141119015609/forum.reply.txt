Text: This is quite the task pulling my Wordpress posts out and making them digestible markdown. So far I settled on the exitwp script found at https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp. This is then followed by a couple of shell scripts to rewrite file names and rewrite the jekyll formatted header to Kirby style headers.
