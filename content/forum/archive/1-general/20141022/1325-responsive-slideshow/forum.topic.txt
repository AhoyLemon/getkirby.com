Text: I am trying out Kirby locally on MAMP (which was very easy to install and runs great btw!) and want to implement slideshows for each of project on a one-page feed. (link:http://europaeuropa.co.uk/ text:Reference link).

Found the tutorial docs on using Carousel and Fancybox were kind of outdated, and I thought to use  (link:http://responsiveslides.com text:Responsive Slides) as suggested in another one year old thread, but can't get it to work.

CSS and javascript are hooked-up, think it is due to my .php:

<?php foreach($project->images() as $image): ?>
    <ul class=“rslides”><li><img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo html($image->title()) ?>" ></li></ul>
<?php endforeach ?> 

Images are called as a list and show-up as such. Any thoughts? Seems like a feature any user would be interested in as standard through the panel.
