Text: I am working on a multi-language site and I have a concern about pages custom fields.

Lets say I have a field "Price", which must be always the same in all languages for one page. As long as I edit the page in the main language (lets say english), I can change the price and all secondary languages will inherit the same value. But if I change my price while I am editing in a secondary language (lets say french), the price will dissynchronize between languages and every subsequent changes will need to be made in both languages, which is not really convenient.

The same problem occurs with image ordering.

A solution for this would be to have a "translatable" setting in the blueprint. Something like this:

```
fields:
  price:
    label: Price
    translatable: true/false
```

If this value would be set to false, editing the value for this field in the panel would only affect the main language file, even when editing in an other  language.

Now, is there a way to implement this?
