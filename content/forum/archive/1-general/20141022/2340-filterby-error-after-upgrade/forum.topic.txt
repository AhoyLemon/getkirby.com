Text: Before the upgrade, I would include a filterBy function in my project page to exclude images titled featured or thumb in the content directory.

```
<?php foreach($page->images()->filterBy('title', '!=', 'featured')->filterBy('title', '!=', 'thumb') as $img): ?>

```

After upgrading to Kirby 2, this is no longer working. Did I miss something?

Thanks!
