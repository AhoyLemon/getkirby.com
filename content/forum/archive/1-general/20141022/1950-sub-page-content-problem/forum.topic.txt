Text: I'm pulling data from a sub-page via the following...

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->find('staff')->children()->find($time)->children() as $subpage): ?>
```

This works fine, but I'm a bit baffled.  That 'staff' sub-page is the only child of the parent page.  However, if I remove the ->find('staff') bit, the page returns an error.  It seems to me it should work fine with the following...

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->children()->find($time)->children() as $subpage): ?>
```

Am I missing something?

Thanks!
