Text: Because Kirby is a flat file cms, and doesn't require a database, it should be as simple as moving the contents of your local site directory to the proper directory of your host (www or public_html most likely, I have no Dreamhost specific experience).

If you run into any issues getting it to load after that post back here with details and I'm sure someone can help.
