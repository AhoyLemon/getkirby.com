Text: Hi,

I am trying to have some sort of a list which is displaying event entries based on text, title and date field ( as well as some others which are not of concern for my question )

I know i would have the option to set a checkbox via blueprint to check if the event is in the past but this would need some manual input so my idea is that to just compare the current time with the date field to see if it's in the past.

anyone has a suggestion how to get it done?

cheers.
