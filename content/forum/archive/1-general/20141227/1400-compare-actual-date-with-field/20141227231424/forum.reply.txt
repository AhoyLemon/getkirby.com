Text: It's pretty straightforward, all you need to do is compare Unix-Timestamps:

```php
<?php 
    $eventDate = $page->date()); //date method returns the Unix timestamp
    $currentDate = strtotime(date("Y-m-d")); //you could simply use time() to get the current Unix timestamp
   
    if($eventDate < $currentDate) { 
        //do stuff; 
    } 
   else { 
        // do sth. else;
    }
?>
