Text: Try this, but I'm not sure if this is what you want:

    <?php $slider= $page->children()->find('slider') ;?>
    <?php if($slider->hasImages()): ?>
    <?php foreach($slider->images() as $image): ?>
    <img src="<?= $image->url()?>">
    <?php endforeach ?>
    <?php endif ?>

Of course, this will only get you all the images in a subfolder called slider of the current page;

Or do you want to get all images of all subfolders called slider site-wide?
