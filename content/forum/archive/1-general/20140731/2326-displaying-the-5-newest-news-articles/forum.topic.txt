Text: Assuming we have a news archive with, let's say, 30 articles. On the start page I want to show the 5 newest articles from this archive. The first idea, I had, was to put a date field in each article and write a template, that parses each article in the archive, to get an array of the 5 newest articles, and then render a news list. That sounds complicated... - are there better ways to do this?

Beyond that it would be nice if one could define a start date and an end date, so that it would be shown only in a defined time span. - Is something like this possible?
