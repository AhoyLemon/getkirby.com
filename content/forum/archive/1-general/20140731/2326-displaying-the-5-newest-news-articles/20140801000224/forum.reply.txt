Text: You could use the following:

          <?php $articles = $pages->findByUID('Page-Name-With-Articles')->children()->visible()->flip()->limit(5); ?>
          <?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>

                Your Article Content Here

          <?php endforeach ?>

First of all its finding the page name where you have the articles. Flipping the resulting articles and then displaying the last 5.

You could also use the sortBy method to sort by date or any other method...
