Text: $pages->visible() only gets you the visible items of the first level, not the children of those folders. Normally, you wouldn't want the subfolders in the main navigation.

You can use a second foreach loop within the first one to fetch the children of each page which would then get the subfolders as well.

    <?php foreach($pages->visible() AS $p): ?>
        <?php foreach $p->children() as $child : ?>
        ....

Maybe add an if condition as well `if($p->hasChildren()) ...`
