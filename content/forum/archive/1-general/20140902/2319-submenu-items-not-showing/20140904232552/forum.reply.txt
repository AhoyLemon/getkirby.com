Text: That gave me this error:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '$p' (T_VARIABLE), expecting '(' in /data/home/synsnerv/public_html/site/snippets/navigation.php on line 10

If I change the second 'foreach' in your suggestion to look like this...

     <?php foreach ($pages->children() as $child): ?>
  
           
...the error disappears, but instead it shows every folder in the content folder - instead of only the ones starting with '00-' or so...
