Text: I am using the monochrome theme, but my sub pages aren't showing in the navigation. What can I do? 

I have a folder called 01-objects. Inside that folder I have another folder called 01-newfolder.

My navigation snippet looks like this:

	<div class="header">
		<ul id="navigation">
			<?php foreach($pages->visible() AS $p): ?>
			<li><a href="<?php echo $p->url() ?>" class="nav"><?php echo html($p->title()) ?></a></li>
			<?php endforeach ?>		
		</ul>
	</div>

I have tried adding snippets from this forum, but I can't get the subfolder to show in the navigation. What to do? I hope you can help!
