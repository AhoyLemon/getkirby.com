Text: Yep. There's a better way to do it than with config file variables; the root of your content folder should have a site.txt file that you can use to define as many site-wide variables as possible.

http://getkirby.com/docs/variables/site

So, in your site.txt file, you'd have (as an example)

    Phone: 555-555-0123
    ----
    Email: me@example.com

And in order to reference them in your page templates, just use the following tag.

    <?php echo $site->phone() ?>

or

    <?php echo $site->email() ?>

You can customize the fields to hold whatever information you need.


If you truly want to define these variables in the config file, you'll be doing way too much work...but here's the link anyways
