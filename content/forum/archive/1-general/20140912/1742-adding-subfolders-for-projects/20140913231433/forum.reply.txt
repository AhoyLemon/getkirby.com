Text: It seems people dislike this suggestion.. they love their folders..

But have you thought about using Tags instead? You can add a tag for each section you'd like it to be seen in. So if a project may fall into multiple categories it can be displayed on both pages.

Or if you want to limit it to 1 section only, you may consider a Select menu with all the options.

With this approach all the projects would be in one folder, no sub directories.

There's no method within the panel for moving a page from one directory to another.

Per <http://ui.getkirby.com/form/fields.yaml>

	tags:
	  label: Tags
	  type: tags

	selectbox:
	  label: Selectbox
	  type: select
	  default: b
	  options:
	    a: Option A
	    b: Option B
	    c: Option C
	    d: Option D
