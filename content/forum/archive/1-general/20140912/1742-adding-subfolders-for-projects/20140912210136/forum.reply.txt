Text: Yes. Create the subfolders and put the pages in the correct ones.

I imagine your question must be more in regards to the template, though. :-)

Instead of just using `->children()->visible()` on the Projects page, use `->children()->children()->visible()` instead. That will pull all of the projects in one list. The URLs for each will include the subfolder, though, so you'll want to make sure that's OK. Also, within each category folder, you'll likely want a text file that at least defines a title field for if you ever want to pull that as a category name.

On the individual project pages, you can also use `->parent()` I think to get the category of that page instead of having a separate categories field.
