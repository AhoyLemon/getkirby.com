Text: Hello! 

I'm working on a portfolio site for a client, and she has a section called 'Projects', and within that about 50+ pages of individual projects. Is there a way to organize the individual projects into subfolders, like 'Editorial', 'Packaging', 'Web', etc. so it is easier for her to manage? 

Thanks in advance!
