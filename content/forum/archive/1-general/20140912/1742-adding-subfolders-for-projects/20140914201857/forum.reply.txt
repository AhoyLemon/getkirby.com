Text: I ended up taking the first suggestion and moving all the folders manually into subfolders. 

The tags were a great suggestion though! We already have a tagging system in place, and the subfolders don't affect the way content is displayed on the client-side-- they are more for the client's peace of mind when she is in Kirby Panel trying to organize all her projects, so instead of seeing one long list on the left, she can now break them down into separate folders. 

Thanks everyone for your help!
