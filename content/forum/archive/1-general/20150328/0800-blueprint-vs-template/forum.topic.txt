Text: I've been poking around, learning how Kirby works for about a week now.  At this point, I'm excited to purchase a license now that I've decided it's exactly what I'm looking for.

One thing I'm a little confused about, however, is the difference between blueprints and templates.  I thought I understood at first (templates determine how pages are displayed, and blueprints determined how they are created), but after reading through the Docs, I'm not so sure.

The main issue is that the Docs and the Panel seem to reference "templates" when they mean blueprints.  For example, adding a new page in the Panel gives you 3 fields ("Add a new page", "URL-appendix", and "Template").  The "template" field is populated with blueprints.

Another example is in the Docs (http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints/page-settings) where they keep referencing blueprints as templates.

So I guess my question is am I missing something obvious here?  Blueprints and templates are entirely different things, correct?

Bonus question:
How do restrict the blueprints/templates that can be chosen at the site level.  Specifying it inside site.txt doesn't seem to do anything, and it's a little weird creating pages at the root/site level showing every template/blueprint possible.
