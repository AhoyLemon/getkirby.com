Text: I am trying to build a front-end form that lets users fill out a request form. First they select a page from a dropdown menu, and then a form is generated based on the template of the page they selected. This means that I do not know beforehand which fields will populate the form. So what I would like to do, is loop through the fields of that page, and for each field determine what type it is (text field, textarea field, etc.) and then build the form based on those values. 

So the question is, is there any way to get the field types of the field in any given template?

It would be even better if I could read the blueprint file associated with the page template, because it has all the info I need (not only type, but the 'help' line would be great to display in my front-end form as well). Is there any way of doing this, or is Kirby not set up for this kind of purpose?
