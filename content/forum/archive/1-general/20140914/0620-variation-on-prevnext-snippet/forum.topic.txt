Text: Hello,

I'm looking for a variation of the (link:https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/prevnext text: PrevNext snippet) that would allow jumping between pages inside different folders. An example folder structure would be:

1-client
    1.1-project
    1.2-project
2-client
   2.1-project
   2.2-project

I'd like the Next link on 1.2-project to jump to 2.1-project and so forth.

One way I thought this could work was to check if a page is the last on its own set and if true then grab the url of the first child of its parent's next sibling.

I don't know enough to turn the above into something that works. Any suggestions?

Thanks!
