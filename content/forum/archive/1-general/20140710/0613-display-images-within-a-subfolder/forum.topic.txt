Text: Hi!

I need to create an image gallery that will look for photos in a subfolder of a blog post folder.

I know the standard code snippet (http://getkirby.com/docs/variables/media), for finding all images within the folder itself.

How can I modify this so that the *<?php if* statement will look inside of a subfolder?

Thanks so much!
