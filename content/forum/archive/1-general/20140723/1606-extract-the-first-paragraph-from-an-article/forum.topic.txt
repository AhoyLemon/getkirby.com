Text: Hello,
I know there already is a useful extract function built-in in Kirby:

`<p><?php echo excerpt($article->text(), 300) ?></p>`

to extract x words from an article.

What I'd like to accomplish is to extract automatically the first paragraph from an article. I know I could just set up a new field, calling something like 'intro', and put it on the article list page, but that's extra work for the client, and I don't that.

I tried a couple of solutions found on the internet, but always missing something.

Any help?

EDIT:
I tried for example this:

`$intro = '';
preg_match("/<p.*?>(.*?)<\/p>/is", $string, $matches);
if (isset($matches[1])) {
    $intro = trim(strip_tags($matches[1]));
}`

replacing $string with a variable I created for that template (in my case `$articletop`), and then tried to output it like this:
`<p><?php echo $intro ?></p>`
but it just output nothing.
