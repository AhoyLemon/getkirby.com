Text: Hey all,

I'm trying to load images from subpages.

```
foreach ($page->children()->visible() as $subpage) {
    echo $subpage->image(); // Returns the absolute path
    echo $subpage->image()->url(); // NULL
}
```

Could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? The $subpage->image(); works fine, returning the absolute path of the file, but the ->url() function is NULL.

Thanks in advance!
