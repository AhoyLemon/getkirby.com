Text: Im working on a site that still runs Kirby 1. I use the maps plugin, which isn't updated for K2, yet. 

Now, I want to shuffle some content and show one random article on my homepage. But the cheatsheet is also updated for K2, so no luck there.

My question, does anyone know how to update the maps plugin, so I can update my Kirby version, or, does anyone know how to shuffle content in Kirby 1? 

Thanks :-)
