I'm trying to output the tags associated with a post on my top level blog page, but I am getting invalid output. At this point, I'm inside the foreach() loop of outputting my posts and trying to grab individual tabs for output alongside them.

When I attempt to do the below, it outputs the relative URL to the post (?!), then the word "pluck" from the command, which is not what I thought it would do. Have I done something simple wrong?

```
<div class="col-lg-4">
<?php $post_tag = $post->pluck('tags', ',', true); ?>
		
			
	<?php foreach($post_tag as $single_tag): ?>
		<?php echo $single_tag ?></br>
	<?php endforeach ?>
</div>
```

Starting to wonder if I need to do the string split on the tag output myself?
