Text: Hi,

I'm trying to wrap Kirbytext images in a div but it's not as easy as it sounds. This is the output of kirbytext at the moment.

          <p>Text Paragraph</p>
          <p>Text Paragraph</p>
          <p>Text Paragraph</p>

                  <figure>       Image here       <figure>
                  <figure>       Image here       <figure>
                  <figure>       Image here       <figure>

         <p>Text Paragraph</p>
         <p>Text Paragraph</p>
         <p>Text Paragraph</p>

                 <figure>       Image here       <figure>

         <p>Text Paragraph</p>
         <p>Text Paragraph</p>
         <p>Text Paragraph</p>

What I'm looking to do is wrap a div around the figure tags regardless of the amount of figure tags. I've implemented a jQuery version which works to an extent but when I load more content into the page it breaks.

I've looked at the Kirbytext tag for the images but cannot seem to find a solution.

Any help would be great.

Cheers!
