Text: Hi @chrisjmartin87,

I'm new to kirby but a quick solution is just to wrap the images in a div while in the control panel or within the text file like so: 

```
<div class='wrap-images'>
[image: about.jpg]
[image: about.jpg]
[image: about.jpg]
</div>
``` 

**Note: I'm using square brackets so tags don't get processed here in my response.**

The above seems to work fine for me. This next one I've not tried but it seems possible to me. Another option might be to create your own `kirbytag` that accepts optional arguments like `prefix:` and `suffix:` so you can pass additional tags.

Example input:

```
[img: about.jpg   prefix: <div class='wrap-images'>]
[img: about.jpg]
[img: about.jpg   suffix: </div>]
```

```
[img: about.jpg   prefix: <div class='decorator'>   suffix: </div>]
```

**Note:** in this example it assumes I've gone through the steps to create my own `kirbytag` called `img` which accepts 3 parameters, making the `prefix:` and `suffix:` parameters optional. I believe you can call any `kirbytext` as a function within your `kirbytag` using a helper method.

Like I said, I'm new to Kirby but those are two quick ideas that came to mind. Hopefully they're helpful.
