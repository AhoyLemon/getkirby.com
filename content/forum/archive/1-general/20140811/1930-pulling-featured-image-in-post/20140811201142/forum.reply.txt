Text: 1. Pulling the URL of the page and then adding an image name after that won't give you the full path to the image. The full path to an image includes the numbers in the folder names because it's a physical file path.
2. What is in your `featimg` field? It appears that it's empty, judging by what's returned.

What I usually do is give a featured image a specific filename. Like featured.jpg or something. Then call that, which would look something like this:

```php
<?php echo $page->prevVisible()->images()->find('featured.jpg')->first()->url() ?>
```

**Note:** I'm not entirely sure if you need the `first()` in there. You might not since this should only return one image. If your file extension might not always be the same (jpg vs png) you'll need to use `filterBy` instead of `find` in order to just filter by the filename.

If you can't name it the same thing all the time, you could have your `featimg` field include the filename of the featured image, then pull that filename and use that to find the correct image. Something like this:

```php
<?php $featuredimage = $page->prevVisible()->featimg() ?>
<section class="next-post" style="background: url(<?php echo $page->prevVisible()->images()->find($featuredimage)->first()->url() ?>) center center no-repeat; background-size: cover; opacity: 0.4;">
```

Again, not sure if you need the `->first()` bit in there or not.

**Also:** All this assumes that you can actually do this with `prevVisible()`.
