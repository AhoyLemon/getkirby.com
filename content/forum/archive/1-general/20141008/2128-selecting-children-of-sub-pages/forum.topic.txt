Text: So my file structure is this:

-  home
-  about
   -  team
        -  1-firstname-lastname
        -  2-firstname-lastname
    -  other child
        - 1-other grandchild

I want to get all the children of  just "team". How would I do that? This is what I tried, which is obviously incorrect. Go easy on me, I just started learning this stuff :)

<?php foreach($pages->find('team')->children()->visible()->limit(4) as $profile): ?>

I would do this:	
<?php foreach(page('about')->children()->children()->visible()->limit(4) as $profile): ?>

But, from what I've read elsewhere on the forum it would end up selecting "other grandchild".
