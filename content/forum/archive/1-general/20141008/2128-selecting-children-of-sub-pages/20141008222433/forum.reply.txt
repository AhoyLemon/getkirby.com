Text: Ok, this arrangement seems to work:
<?php foreach($page->children()->find('team')->children()->visible()->limit(4) as $profile): ?>

But I don't understand why. Could someone explain the logic behind the syntax? Teach a man to fish and all that. Thanks in advance for any help understanding this.
