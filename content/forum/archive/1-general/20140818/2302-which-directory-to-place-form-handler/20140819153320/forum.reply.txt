Text: I'm not entirely sure I follow you, but here are kind of some guidelines that might be useful:

1. If it's going to be used in one place, you could put it in a template.
2. If you might want to re-use it and embed it in multiple places, make it a snippet.
3. Not sure exactly the best time to make it a plugin, but I usually do that if I'm processing text or doing some sort of limiting or sorting function on an object. Might be useful here too I guess.
