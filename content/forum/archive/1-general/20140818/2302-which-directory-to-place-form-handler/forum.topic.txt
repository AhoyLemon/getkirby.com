Text: Hi guys, 

I have a PHP form handler script I'm going to use on my Kirby site, but not sure which directory to put it in. Should I put it in Templates, Snippets or Plugins? 

And if I put it in one of those directories, is it secure to link to it using a relative link in my form itself (which is in a template). 

Hope that makes sense. 

Cheers
