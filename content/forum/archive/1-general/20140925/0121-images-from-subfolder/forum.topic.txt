Text: Hello

I almost have this working now - after a lot of help from the forum: 
I get videos from my main folder. They are lined up and they play in a fancybox overlay (that was pretty difficult for me). 

Now, they videos are supposed to be represented by an image which loads from a subfolder. Right now, the first image in the folder is loaded and that same image is applied to each video. Of course, I want a unique image for each video. 

So, I have three videos in my main folder and three images in the subfolder. The first of the images is shown for all three videos, but all images should show - image 01 for video 01, image 02 for video 02, image 03 for video 03. 

Does it make sense? I can see that the problem is, that I am using $images -> first, but I don't know what else to do. Can you help?

Here's the code:

		<?php $imagepage = $page->children()->first() ?>
		<?php $images = $imagepage->images() ?>             
		
		
		
		    <?php if($page->hasVideos()): ?> 
		    <div style="clear:both;background-color:white; width:100%; height:500px;">
		    <div style="clear:both;list-style:none;margin-left:-24px;margin-top:-280px;" class="gallery">
		  <?php foreach($page->videos() as $video): ?>
		 
                  <div>
		  <a class="jwVideo" rel="gallery" href="<?php echo $video->url() ?>"><img src="<?php echo $images->first()->url() ?>" /></a>
		  </div><div>
		  <?php endforeach ?>
		</div>
		</div>
		<?php endif ?>
