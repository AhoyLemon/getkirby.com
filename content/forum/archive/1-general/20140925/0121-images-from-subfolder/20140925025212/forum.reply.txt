Text: 1. I'm not sure why you need the images in subfolders. It would probably be easier to have them in the main folder, named the same as the videos with different extensions.
2. That being said, your issue is that you're explicitly getting the first child once instead of getting the image that corresponds to the video at every point in the loop. That's what `$imagepage = $page->children()->first()` does. It gets the list of pages that are children of the current page, and then gets the first one. So you're always getting the images of the first child page no matter what else you do.

So you need to somehow use the name of the video to match it up with the photo. I would recommend doing that by not actually having the photos in a subpage, but having them as photos in the main page. Then use PHP to parse the name of the video and then use that to pull the necessary image using `->filterBy()`. There are some instructions about filterBy in this article. http://getkirby.com/blog/1-1-1
