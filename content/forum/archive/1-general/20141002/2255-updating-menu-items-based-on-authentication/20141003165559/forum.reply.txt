Text: Hey Uwe,

Thanks for your reply.

Your solution would work if the items were not generated automatically by the first block of code on my description above.

The problem I'm having (and I should've done a better job explaining it) is how can I target the second item of a list that's generated automatically?

I'm guessing it'd have to be something to do with the foreach loop:

    <?php foreach($items as $item): ?>

Before finishing the loop it should make the replacement of the item based on the user being logged in or not. I might be overcomplicating things, though.
