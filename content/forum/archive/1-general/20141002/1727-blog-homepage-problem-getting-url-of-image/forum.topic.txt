Text: my homepage code will collect content from internal pages and couple them with an image named featured.png and placed in the same directory of that page.
I can loop through the pages and get the bit of text that I need from the txt file. However I cannot seem to get the url of that image to do my <img src> (I know I can go through kirbytext or markdown, but I'd like to learn how to do it with kirby and php only).

From the home page, inside my php code, These two return the expected result:
*echo $pages->findByUID('projectA');*
*echo $pages->findByUID('projectA')->url();*

However, from this point on, what I imagined would be straight forward returns nothing:
*echo $pages->findByUID('projectA')->images();*

or worse, i get a fatal error (Fatal error: Call to a member function find() on a non-object) here:
*echo $pages->findByUID('projectA')->images()->find('featured.png')->url();*

If anybody can point me to here I may be going wrong, please do.
kirby (and php) are fairly new territory for me and I am sure these are simple to solve, but I am at the bottom of the learning curve I am afraid :-/

Thanks!
