Text: Hi,

First off i'm quite a newbie when it comes to using git.

I'm a bit unsure about how one would use git to keep track of the changes you make and still keep the github repo for pulling updates. 

My scenario would be sth. like: 

Production Server (where the webpage runs)
Github Repo(Where the updates are)
Localhost(where i develop)

If you could point me in the right direction i'd be greatful :)
