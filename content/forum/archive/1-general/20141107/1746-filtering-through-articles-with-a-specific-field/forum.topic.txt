Text: I've got a select tag in the articles blueprint. I want to then filter my articles by the value of that select tag So I have

Blueprint:

```
  author:
    label: Post Author
    type: select
    required: true
    options:
      Author One: one
      Author Two: two
```

Template:

```
<?php $articles = page('blog')->children()->visible()->flip()->paginate(5)->filterBy('author', '==', 'one') ?>
<?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>
      <li><a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></a></li>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

This isn't working. Any suggestions on how to properly do this?
