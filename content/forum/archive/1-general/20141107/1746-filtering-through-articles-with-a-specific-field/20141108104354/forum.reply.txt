Text: I see two problems with your code:

1. I think the `paginate(5)`should only be applied after the filtering, otherwise it doesn't make sense.

2. In your blueprint, put the options the other way round.

```yaml
options:
  one: Author One
  two: Author Two
```

The first bit, i.e. "one" and "two" are the values that go into your textfile and are thus the values you can filter by. The text after the colon is what is shown to the editor in the select field.
