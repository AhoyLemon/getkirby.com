Text: When I visit my local development site at site.dev I get a blank page. I can only see the site when I visit site.dev/blog. This has only happened since upgrading to Kirby 2.

I already have an instruction in .htaccess, which I thought fixed this:

`RedirectMatch 301 ^/blog/(.*)$ /$1`

Is there something I’m missing, anyone? Any suggestions appreciated.
