Text: I haven't tried, but maybe:

```

$posts = $pages->find('work', 'journal')
    ->children()
    ->visible()

$posts = $posts->sortBy('date', 'desc')

```

Obviously it requires you to have a date field (you can do it with another field, but I think you need a field). Point here is to first create the collection containing both sub-collections, then order it as one collection.
