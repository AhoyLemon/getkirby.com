Text: It is possible to get content from two folders at the same time:
```
$posts = $pages->find('work', 'journal')
                   ->children()
                   ->visible()
                   ->flip();
```
Which results in an output like this:
```
journal 10
...
journal 1
work 10
...
work 1
```
Is there a way to combine those objects and sort them by date which would result in something more like:
```
journal 10
work 10
journal 9
journal 8
work 9
â€¦
```
