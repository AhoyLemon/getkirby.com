Text: Any Idea to to kinda limit / paginate a list of pictures / thumbs?

I am trying to archive having an imagegallery  with approximatly 1600 pictures and already sorted them in categories. but a few folders just take some time loading - parsing whatever you want to call it.

So i thought about if the usual pagination codes can somehow be implemented on pictures only as well.

Cheers.
