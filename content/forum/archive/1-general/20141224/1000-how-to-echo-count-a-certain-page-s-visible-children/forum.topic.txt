Text: Good day everybody,

can someone please told me how to rephrase this code `<?php if($page->children()->count() => '100') { echo '99+';} else { echo $page->children()->count();} ?>`... It doesn't work on my kirby template... What I want to do it that to make a navbar that has a badge how many sub pages it has. For example I have a `Projects` menu and it has 3 visible children named `Project-a`, `Project-b` and lastly the `Project-c` and I want to echo `3` because the `Projects` menu has 3 visible children/subpages, another thing is that I want it to echo `99+` if the Menu has 100 and above childrens, and if the Menu has below 99 subpages I want it to echo the exact number it has..

I know my English is ridiculous, but I'm trying my best. I'm still 14. If you have  any clarifications, please don't hesitate to ask me or you can just email me directly (IF YOU WANT :) ).  I hope you can answer my question. 

Wish you all the best,
