Text: Hello everyone I would like to ask something..

Does it really matter when using these site keywords without space after the comma? 

like:
```
this,is,a,keyword
 ```
or it requires the space like
```
this, is, a, keyword
```
Whenever I type another site keyword at the Panel
it outputs it without space. It also does the same thing at kirby's tags.
