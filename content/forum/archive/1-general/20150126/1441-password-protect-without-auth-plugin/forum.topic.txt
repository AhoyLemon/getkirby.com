Text: Hi,

I was coding some sort of gallery to list files/pictures with pagination automatically, so i have multiple pages showing pictures. 

I wanted to add a password before displaying but not using the authentication plugin with user and passwor. 

I tried starting going with the get() function but it's not working thoughout all paginated pages. I'd have to type in the password on each page:x again. So basically i am stuck with working with sessions so the password which is entered will be saved thoughout all pages. 

Anyone has a smart and easy advice to get the password being saved thoughout multiple pages?

Does the $user functions like $user->login() work without the additional use of sessions? 

Cheers.
