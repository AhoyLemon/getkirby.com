Text: Hi there,

I have a Kirby 2.0.5 installed on my PC (with XAMPP). My problem is that if I set my "01-blog" folder as the homepage with `c::set('home', 'blog');`, the pagination breaks, also the blogposts' permalinks.

The blogpost permalinks return the Kirby error page, while the pagination links return `403 Forbidden`.

Even the fresh Kirby install with the unmodified Baseblog theme doesn't seem to work...

I use the default Baseblog `.htaccess` file (also tried the default Kirby `.htaccess`), and my XAMPP install has the `rewrite` module enabled.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Adam
