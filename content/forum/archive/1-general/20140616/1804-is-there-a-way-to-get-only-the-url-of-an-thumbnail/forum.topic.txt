Text: Hi,
I use the supersized jqueryplugin and now I have a little problem with thumbnails.
If I use the Kirbythumbnail-plugin I have an problem, because the plugin is generating the img-element and not only the thumbnail-url like 

	<?php echo $image->url() ?>

Is there a way to output only the thumbnail-url through the thumb-plugin or have anybody another idea how I can get thumbnails for the plugin?

Greetings
