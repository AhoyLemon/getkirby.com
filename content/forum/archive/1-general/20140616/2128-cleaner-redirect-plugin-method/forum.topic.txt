Text: Hi,

I'm working on figuring out a way to implement a simpler system of redirects, rather than creating a page for each and pointing it to a template. Has anyone attempted this, successfully or unsuccessfully? I'm doing so in Kirby 2.0 atm, but thoughts on 1.0 that I could possibly convert are welcome as well.

My thought was to track down part of the code where it detects missing pages and redirects to the error page. I've found that in the core/kirby.php file, but my attempts at making this function so far have been failures. In most cases, it seems to just ignore my if statements and go directly to the error page.

I've tried adding a snippet to the error page for redirect statements, but even though the url shows the page I'm trying to visit, the $page->url() will return the error page url. When trying to retrieve a referrer url, the values always turn up empty (perhaps because I am manually entering the url, rather than clicking a link to the page?).

I'd prefer to avoid cluttering up the panel page tree and directories with tons of clutter specifically for redirects. I'd also like the versatility of redirecting specific url that contain string queries as well. Ideally I will implement this into panel as well, so urls can be updated in an even friendlier manner.

Thanks,
Luke
