Text: This might not be the solution you're looking for, but here are some ideas:

- Use Apache/HTACCESS redirects.

- Modify your Kirby template where the page content is displayed and add multiple if statements that redirect to the appropriate page.

- Create a custom template called 'redirects' with only two fields defined (something like 'redirectsource' and 'redirecturl'). Create a directory 'redirects' in the content folder and make individual folder/file pairs for each redirect (content/redirects/def with def.txt inside). Now when the page loads have Kirby loop through the pages in the 'redirects' folder and if the URL matches then redirect. This solution also allows you to add, edit, and delete your redirects in the Panel. Just go under the 'redirects' directory and there's everything. I've used this technique successfully for displaying employee contact records, calendar events, etc.

I hope this helps!
