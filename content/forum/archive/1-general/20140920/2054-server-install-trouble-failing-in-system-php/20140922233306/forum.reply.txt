Text: Update:

I'm guessing something is wrong in my config.php or my .htaccess. I've tried using Lee Johnson's "Hardcore" .htaccess example from an earlier post in General:

http://pastebin.com/VLXFfxnK

And then this slimmer one:

https://github.com/lehni/kirbycms/blob/ad38431439aca9e0cdf35c190e02f9ba878d5d25/.htaccess

... both modified so that the root kirby directory is "/boggy" as it is on my server:

RewriteBase /boggy

With those I still get a blank page, but a 500 error comment in View Source:

SHTML Wrapper - 500 Server Error

I've tried setting about every permutation of c::set('url') and c::set('subfolder') I can think of, or commenting them out so Kirby can "detect the correct URL" as it says in config. Nothing going yet.

If anybody sees I'm making a dumb mistake right off, I'd appreciate you pointing it out!

More updates:
These are the most consistent errors in my PHP logs, relating to load.php and the line where it tries to require yaml.php:

[23-Sep-2014 10:22:52] PHP Warning:  require_once(/.../boggy/kirby/parsers/yaml.php) [<a href='function.require-once'>function.require-once</a>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /.../boggy/kirby/lib/load.php on line 58

[23-Sep-2014 10:22:52] PHP Fatal error:  require_once() [<a href='function.require'>function.require</a>]: Failed opening required '/.../boggy/kirby/parsers/yaml.php' (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php') in /.../boggy/kirby/lib/load.php on line 58

But of course, yaml.php is right there in the 'parsers' subdir where it's suppposed to be.

Resolved.
yaml.php actually wasn't there for some reason. Put it up individually and started getting pages returned. From there I was able to work out the right config settings.
