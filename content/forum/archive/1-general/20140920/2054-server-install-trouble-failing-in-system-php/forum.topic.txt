Text: Hi. I've uploaded my Kirby site to my Bluehost server and it is only returning blank on the root index.php. It was working fine on my local MAMP install.

I confirmed with host that mod_rewrite is enabled, and followed Sebastian's directions on the config.php settings, and set a .htaccess in the subfolder with ReWrite set to the subfolder.

So my config uses:

c::set('url', 'http://mysite.net/mysubdir');

c::set('subfolder', 'mysubdir');

c::set('rewrite', true);

After changing all the "localhost" references (for MAMP) and uploading, I had one error in config.php, which was my fault. After fixing that and my localhost references, it stopped returning the initial error and went blank. I stuck echo statements in system.php (the first thing index.php leads to) and tracked down that it was the call to the load class parser() method that fails:

(line 39 of system.php) 
load::parsers(); 

If I comment that line out, it gets through system.php and into the header.php, where it fails on... presumably the first thing that needs parser() to have worked: the html($site->title()) call. But at least it returns something!

I think I've done all the settings correctly, unless I'm dense. Any suggestions?
