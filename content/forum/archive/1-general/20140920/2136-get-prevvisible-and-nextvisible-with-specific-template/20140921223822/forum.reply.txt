Text: Almost. Apparently I can't use `new Pages`, although the `$pages` object is a `Children` object, so I could use `new Children` instead on Kirby 2. I can filter through all the siblings using this:

    $pagination = $page->siblings()->visible()->filterBy('template', '==', 'article');

This already generates a `Children` object, like `$pages`, I just don't know where to go from here.

EDIT: Should the `siblings()` object contain the `$page`?
