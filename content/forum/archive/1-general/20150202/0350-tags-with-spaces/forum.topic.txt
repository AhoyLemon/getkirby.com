Text: Hi,

I'm using Kirby 2 with a few tags that have spaces in them. When I output them, they don't automatically get %20 added, but when the user clicks the link the browser handles this. Unfortunately, the tags come up empty for the ones with spaces. Is there something specific I need to do to get tags with spaces working? I found some answers relating to the original Kirby but no the new one.
