Text: You might want to use (link: https://github.com/studiodumbar/kirby-extensions/tree/master/plugins/tagslug text: tagslug) and its sister plugin, (link: https://github.com/studiodumbar/kirby-extensions/tree/master/plugins/tagunslug text: tagunslug).

The URL should contain tagslug-ed tags (for instance "pride-and-prejudice"), and the search page will be tagunslug-ing the searched-for tag back into human-optimized (for instance, "Pride & Prejudice").
