Text: I might not have explained myself well but what I wanted was __one collection of images__, not iterating over several pages and outputting each page's images after another.

By inspecting Kirby's "core" (kirby/toolkit/lib/collection.php) I found a solution.

```
<?php
    $all_galleries = $site->index()->filterBy('template', 'gallery');
    $featured_images = new Collection();

    foreach($all_galleries as $gallery) {
        foreach ($gallery->images()->filterBy('featured', 'true') as $image) {
            $featured_images = $featured_images->append($image->filename(), $image);
        }
    }

    $featured_images = $featured_images->sortBy('featured_sort', 'asc');

    foreach ($featured_images as $image) {
        echo thumb($image, array('height' => 150));
    }
?>
```

Maybe this is useful for somebody else in the future. I'm definitely interested in any better way to accomplish this. :-)
