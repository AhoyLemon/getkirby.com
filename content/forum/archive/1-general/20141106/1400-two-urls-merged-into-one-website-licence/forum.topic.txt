Text: Hi,

I'm thinking of whether to merge a personal blog into a professional business similar to how [Boagworld][8848-001] and [Headscape][8848-002] did but I was curious whether I would need to purchase one or two licences as it's all on one install of Kirby but running two sites.

Not being tight, just curious.

Thanks.
