Text: Okay I just tried getting Kirby to work on Azure Websites (which is IIS based).
I just copied the Web.Config from @alexwichti (http://pastebin.com/eVicUuYp) and gave it a go.
It looks like most of the stuff is working, but here are some things that didnt work:
 - The builtin Icons (Font Awesome) are not shown in the panel anymore
 - Thumb plugin is not working correctly. The original images are shown instead of a thumb. (thumb was probably not generated)

Do you guys have any idea how I should modify my web.config in order to get this stuff running?

PS. I created a ticket for official IIS support. Hope this will land in one of the updates :o)
