Text: Im working on a Project where  i have to deal with Keywords (like tags) wich have sometimes multiple words like in "Hans Mustermann".

I'm trimming and lowercasing does keywords ($key) to obtain a more readable url wich allows my to create an url like this: "â€¦/projects/keyword:hans-mustermann"
```
<?php
    $trim = preg_replace( "/[^a-zA-Z0-9.?!]/", '-', strtolower( $key ) );
?>
```

I then try to filter the url parameter but obviously it wont match.

```
<?php
	if($key = param('key')) {
  		$articles = $articles->filterBy('keywords', $key, ',');
	}
?>
```
 
What would be a possible approach to solve this problem  ?
