Text: So, if I have an alternative language, e.g. Russian, I used this kirbytext for the links:
`( link:contacts text:Свяжитесь с нами)`

But after I updated to Kirby 2, I have to write links like this
`( link:ru/contacts text:Свяжитесь с нами)` in order to send user to the page in selected language?
Now `( link:contacts text:Свяжитесь с нами)`sends to the default language, which is not Russian.
