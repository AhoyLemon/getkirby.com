Text: Hi there

I want to alter the Kirbytext so the first character of the "Text" of every article is placed in between <span class="dropcap"> and </span>

So a text like:
```
Lhdusah dashudas dosajdsaod
```
Will be rendered like:
```
<span class="dropcap">L</span>hdusah dashudas dosajdsaod
```
Any ideas?
