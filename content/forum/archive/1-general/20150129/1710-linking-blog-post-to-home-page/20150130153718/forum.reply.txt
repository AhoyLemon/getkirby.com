Text: @jkbplns But home isn't the articles page. I have an /articles page which will list the latest posts and I need the /home page to have the home page content along with a few 'featured images' from the latest posts.

By setting the 'articles' to home page in config will mean the main domain will redirect to the listings of the blog posts right?
