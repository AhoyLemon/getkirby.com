Text: Sorry to probably state the obvious here but I'm trying to link content from blog posts which are at `domain.com/articles` on the home page. My code currently is:
``` html
<ul class="prev">
  <?php foreach($pages->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo $article->title()->html() ?></a></h3>
      </li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```
Which works for the `domain.com/articles` page when listing the posts so this is obviously just a small thing where I'm linking the wrong directory. Or at least I think it is. I have been trying various alternatives to try and figure this out but it's doing my head in now so any help would be amazing.

Also is it possible to link to a particular post with a certain tag, so that one is more prominent on the homepage.

Many thanks (as always)
