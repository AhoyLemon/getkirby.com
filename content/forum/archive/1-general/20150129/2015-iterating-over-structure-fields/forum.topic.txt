Text: I'm using a simple structure field like this:

```
persons:
  label: Persons
  type: structure
  entry: >
    {{name}}
  fields:
    name:
      label: Name
      type: text
    description:
      label: Description
      type: textarea
    image:
      label: Image
      type: select
      options: images
```

but I cannot get it to iterate in the template. I tried numerous ways without success :/

Shouldn't something like this work?

```
foreach($page->persons() as $obj) {
  echo $obj->name();
}
```

I get a fatal error this way.

Any idea? It's probably really simple, I just can't see it :D
