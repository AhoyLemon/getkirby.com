Text: I don't think the standard filterBy will do that, because it's looking for a field. However, I think you could do it like this:

```php
<? foreach($pages->index() AS $post): ?>
    <ul>
    <? if($post->template() == 'post'): ?>
        <li><a href="<?= $post->url() ?>"><?= $post->title() ?></a></li>
    <? endif ?>
    </ul>
<? endforeach ?>
```
