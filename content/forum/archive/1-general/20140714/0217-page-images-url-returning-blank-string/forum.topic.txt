Text: I'm trying to embed a series of images from certain projects using

	<img src="<?php echo $page->images()->url() ?>" >

but it is returning a blank string when I check the rendered html. without the ->url() it returns the correct link in "a" tags. What am I doing wrong?

edit: I eventually got it to work using strip_tags:

	<img src="<?php echo strip_tags($page->images()) ?>">

but I'm still confused as to why the first example doesn't work
