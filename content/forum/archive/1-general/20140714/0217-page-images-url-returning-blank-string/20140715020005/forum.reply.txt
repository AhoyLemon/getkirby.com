Text: You're pulling all images and trying to get a URL. You need to pull only one image. There are several ways you can do that.

```php
<img src="<?= $page->images()->first()->url() ?>">
```

```php
<img src="<?= $page->images()->find('header.png')->url() ?>">
```

I don't remember if that last one will work as is, or if you have to also include the ->first() in it.
