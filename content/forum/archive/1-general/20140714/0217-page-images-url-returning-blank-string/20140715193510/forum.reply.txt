Text: I'm sure that `$page->images()` returns a set of images even if there's only one. So calling `$page->images()->url()` will never give you what you're looking for. Calling `$page->images()` returns the entire object, hence the actual clickable link. If there were multiple images, it would return all of them in the same format. Because you only have one image, `strip_tags()` will return the URL, but if there were multiple it would return multiple URLs.

So using `->first()` will get you the first image. If you only have one image, then it will return that one image. If you have more than one, it will return the first one sorted alphabetically, unless you apply a `->sort()` filter to it.
