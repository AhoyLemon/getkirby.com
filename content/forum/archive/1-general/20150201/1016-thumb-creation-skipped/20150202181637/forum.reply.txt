Text: Okay, so for some reason my Mac machine does it fine and it didn't work on the Chromebook. For now I'll just assume it's a matter of MAMP's default setup vs LAMP's default setup not working the same way (there are other things that don't work on the Chromebook, such as url rewriting).

Ah well. For now, issue partially solved (and most likely the remainder of the issue has nothing to do with Kirby).
