The images are rather small (usually within the 1~2 Mo range, the biggest may reach 5 Mo?) but now that I think of it, I haven't seen thumb() work on the machine I'm currently using to code (a modified Chromebook running Ubuntu - specs-wise, there shouldn't be any problem but who knows?). I'm gonna try and run a test on my usual machine tonight to see whether that changes anything.

The images are definitely bigger than the resulting thumbs should be.

Thumb folder writable -> I just set it to 777 to see whether that fixed anything, and it didn't.

Too many images -> Clearly not, it doesn't work even if there is only one image to thumb.

Cache problem -> As far as I know, cache isn't activated (at least, not on dev machine and I can't remember using it at all), so a priori nope.

The code doesn't generate any thumb in the thumb folder (it just completely ignores the thumb request, and pulls the original image instead). This really looks like a bare bug to me.

Actually, now that I think about it I think the last time I had a problem with thumbs was on 2.0.3 and this problem was solved by updating to 2.0.4. Current code has been tested on 2.0.5 and 2.0.6, but maybe 2.0.4 is the only one that actually works? I'll try reverting to 2.0.4 tonight and see what happens.
