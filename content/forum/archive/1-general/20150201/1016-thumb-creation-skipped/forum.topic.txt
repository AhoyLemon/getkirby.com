Text: Struggling with thumbnails again! And just like last time, I have no idea whether it's my code or the function that is buggy.

This time, I'm trying to structure my images in a Galleries -> Gallery -> Image structure (as in, each individual Image has its own folder and its own page to allow detailed description as well as advanced display customization), which is located in a Gallery which in turn is located in the Galleries folder at the content root). 

As a consequence, I need a way for Gallery to display a thumb for each Image it contains and that requires creating said thumb.


Controller code for the Gallery template: 

```

<?php

return function($site, $pages, $page) {
	// get all articles and add pagination
	$articles = $page->children()->visible()->sortBy('date', 'desc')->paginate(20);

	// create a shortcut for pagination
	$pagination = $articles->pagination();

	//pass $articles and $pagination to the template
	return compact('articles', 'pagination');
};

```

Relevant code within the Gallery template:

```

<div class="gallery">
  <?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>
    <?php foreach($article->images() as $image): ?>
        <a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>">
          <img src="<?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true), false) ?>">
        </a>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</div>

```

As is, the Gallery template simply displays the original images, completely bypassing thumb creation and display. Desired output would be "each Image's thumb is displayed with a link to the Image's page" instead.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
