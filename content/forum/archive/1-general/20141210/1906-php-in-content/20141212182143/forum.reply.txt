Text: I feel like I've tried this in the past (not positive), but I don't think it worked. You can enable markdown extra to allow HTML.. which believe also allows the ability to include javascript/css directly into the content.txt file.. but not PHP.

For HTML, in site/config/config.php add:

	c::set('markdown.extra', true);
