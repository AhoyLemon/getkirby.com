Text: Is anyone aware of a way to access $site and/or $pages for use in a function, that's in plugin, without having to pass $site in when calling the function?

Right now I'm calling it like this:

settings($block, $property, $site)

But I'd like to cut out the ", $site" by having the object become available inside the function itself. Maybe it seems like a minor issue to some, but I just don't feel it should have to be stated each time I want to retrieve a setting.

I've tried the "global $site" method that I use in tags, to no avail.

I've tried just including $site in the function property, but not when calling the function (similar to the method demonstrated in controllers), but that doesn't work.

I can't use template controllers because it needs to be accessible on every page.
