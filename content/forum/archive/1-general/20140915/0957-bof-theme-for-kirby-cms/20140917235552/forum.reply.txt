About the 'quite expensive'; it's all a matter of perspective:

I think it's quite obvious that a lot of time and consideration has been put into this theme. The theme is packed with features and there is an extensive documentation covering all those features in great detail. Imho there are not that many (if any) of these kind of themes for Kirby around.
