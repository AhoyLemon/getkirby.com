Text: UPDATE:  the theme has been updated for Kirby version 2

We've made a theme for Kirby. It is well documented and it's packed with features, so this might appeal to a wide range of users:

• It's responsive (all measurements are in ems and %);
• Modest in it's style – content first;
• Ten color options to choose from;
• Easy to adjust with page specific css or js files;
• Proper formatting of all html/typographic elements;
• You can also use footnotes and custom inline list styles;
• Print ready style sheets;
• Multiple languages;
• Tags/categories;
• Five different page types;
• Create blocks (columns) of images and pictures anywhere in the body text;
• Use a fixed full width banner slider at the top of the page;
• Use an image slider anywhere on the page;
• Use an image gallery with lightbox;
• Use images with captions and/or use thumbnails of images aligned left or right with a lightbox function;
• Static share buttons that don't slow down page loads; you can specify them per page;
• Specify authors in a central place;
• Use rotating 'slogans' (text, image) in the header;
• Use Youtube or Vimeo video's in article previews on collection-pages or use a 'still' image from the video or your own images;
• Ready for your Disqus comments – just get an account;
• Deep page nesting, great for more complex structures;
• Work with the Kirby Panel or just with files and ftp;
• RSS feed, Sitemap for search engines, Google Analytics;
• Works with modern browsers IE9 and higher;
• Besides all that, it's easy to use and install – that's what we all love about Kirby CMS!
