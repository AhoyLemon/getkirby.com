Text: Hi,
I have various articles with different imagefiletypes.
The folders for the articles are invisible so that they don't will shown in the menu.

Now my problem is if I write 
```
…$article->images()->find('image') 
```
or 
```
…$article->images()->find('image.*') 
```
it works only with 
```
…$article->images()->find('logo.jpg').
```
and than I don't have png in some folder. If I have nothing is shown, also not the jpg-files.
Have someone a solution for me?
