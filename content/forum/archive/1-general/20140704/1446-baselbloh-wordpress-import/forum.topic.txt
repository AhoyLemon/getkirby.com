Text: Hi there, I am new here and I just wanted to test Kirby, if it could be an alternative to my wordpress site.

I therefor installed all, it worked perfectly. Then I added the Panel, still - all working fine. 

Second I imported my wordpress blog to ../content/blog/.. and
Third I installed as mentioned the "baseblog Kirby Theme".

and then: (A) The panel working fine, still; but (B) the index or home calls out a fatal error:
"Fatal error: Cannot redeclare go() (previously declared in D:\xampp\htdocs\kirbyCMS\kirby\lib\kirby.php:28) in D:\xampp\htdocs\kirbyCMS\kirby\lib\kirby.php on line 49"

As you can see I am using the newest xamp version for XP.

Any suggestions for me?
Looking forward for some help.
Thanks in advance
