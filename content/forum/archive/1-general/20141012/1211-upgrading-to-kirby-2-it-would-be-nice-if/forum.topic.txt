Text: I'm in the process of upgrading to Kirby 2 a Kirby 1 website, but I got a bunch of errors that I'm trying to solve.

It would be nice if Bastian would provide a list of Kirby 1 api's that are not supported in Kirby 2, with the right replacement.

It would be also nice to have a list of the new features, so I can judge about the opportunity to upgrade a site to the new Kirby, or to wait a few more iterations.

Thank you
