Text: Probably: look for a property the sub-menu you're aiming to suppress has (depending on context, this might be "whether the sub-menu is currently open" (isOpen iirc), or "whether the submenu is marked as "hidden" (you can achieve this by adding a "Hidden" field in the corresponding page's text file, and giving it a value)).

Then, in your menu loop, go (for instance):

```
<?php foreach ($menuitem as $item): ?>
<?php if ($item->hidden() == "") ?>
<insert display code here>
<?php endif ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

Here, I'm using the "Hidden" field, and checking whether it's empty or not. If it's empty, I display the menu normally, else I hide it.

If you're aiming to context-dependent targets, probably use isOpen() instead: 

```
<?php if ($item->isOpen()): ?>
<empty code>
<?php else ?>
<display code>
<?php endif ?>
```

I'm using "else" here to reverse isOpen()'s effect, but there might be a isNotOpen() function.
