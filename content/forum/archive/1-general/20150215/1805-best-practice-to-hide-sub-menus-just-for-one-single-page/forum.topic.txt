Text: Hello together,

i'm fairly new to Kirby, but i absolutely love it so far, and intuitively i got a lot of stuff done very quickly.

I want to use the standard popup sub-menu which is integrated in the default template. However i do not want to see a sub-menu for one of the menu points.

I can't use the Visibility-property, since i use that for other features. So i need a way to manually suppress the sub-menu for this single point.

Any ideas?

Thanks for your help!
