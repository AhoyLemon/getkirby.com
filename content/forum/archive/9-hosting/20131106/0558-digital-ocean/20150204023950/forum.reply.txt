Text: I am having the same problem.

The homepage of my site works, but every other page throws an error.

I tried adding what was suggested, to the default-000.conf, and site-specific .conf file, and restarted apache, but I'm still getting 404s for all pages.

Can you help me figure this out @syropian?
