Text: I've been playing with kirby on a local MAMP server recently, and today I decided to test it on my live server at webhostinghub.com. It isn't working out of the box, though. The home page is showing up, but all of the links are broken – they each show a 404 page. 

I downloaded the kirby starter kit and uploaded it to the server to see if I had messed something up along the way, but I'm having the same issue with that as well. I also tried it at the root directory to see if there was an issue with the routing or subdomains or something. Again, the same issue. Every link is a 404.

From what I can tell, the server meet the system requirements, but I contacted the host too just in case. I also checked the permissions, and they're set to 755.

You can find the starter kit here:

Any ideas?
