Text: I've run into this issue, and have managed to get the site working by commenting out the 'function get' part in the lib/kirby.php file.

However, i'm running into issues with the panel etc. - can you give a bit more info on how to "edit any occurrences of get(..) to use the class override r::get(..)"?

Do I just swap any occurrence of get(..) with r::get(..)??

Cheers.
