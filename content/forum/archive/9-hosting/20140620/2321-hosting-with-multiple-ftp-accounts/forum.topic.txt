Text: I have been very pleased with my hosting at (link:www.gandi.net text:Gandi). I'm able to host a bunch of domains for different clients on my hosting plan and will only pay to scale up as I need to.

But, there is one drawback: I cannot create multiple FTP accounts with user access restrictions. I would like to give clients direct FTP access, even though the panel will be able to take care of 99% of their needs. But, because of the way their servers are structured (forgive me, I don't know the details), I cannot create restricted FTP accounts that only have access to particular directories.

This hasn't been a big concern, but is a growing one, and when my plan at Gandi expires soon I'm considering changing to somewhere else. Does anyone else in this situation have any suggestions?

Or, better yet, does anyone know of any "FTP-ish" solutions? I'm wondering if there is some sort of FTP web interface that could do this sort of thing?
