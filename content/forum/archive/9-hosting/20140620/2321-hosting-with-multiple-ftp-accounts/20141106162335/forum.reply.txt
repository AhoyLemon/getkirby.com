I wound up getting a hosting account with Namecheap, as for a couple more dollars per month you can get a reseller account, which allows you to set up separate spaces for each domain. This allows you to set up separate FTP accounts for each space, too.

I've had this for about a year, and so far, the uptime has been better than with Bluehost.
