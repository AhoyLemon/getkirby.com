Text: I read a few old posts, and they lacked some clarity, so I thought I'd post my findings.

When setting up a new droplet on Digital Ocean, a quick, easy way to get your server up and running is to install it with their LAMP stack (although it's unlikely you'll use MySQL with Kirby). But mod_rewrite isn't enabled by default on your new droplet. Documentation doesn't line up perfectly between older versions of ubuntu and the latest, so here's what I found:

First activate mod_rewrite

```
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

To use mod_rewrite in your .htaccess file that you've uploaded to /var/www/html, you need to edit the default VirtualHost

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Find a block that looks like this, and add AllowOverride All: (Note, if your file doesn't have this, you can add it within the VirtualHost tags)

```
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>
```

And when you've saved that (control + x, then y to save it), restart apache2

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Hopefully this helps someone out there!
