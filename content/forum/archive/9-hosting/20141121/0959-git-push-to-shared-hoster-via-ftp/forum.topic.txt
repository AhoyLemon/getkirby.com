Text: I just discovered Git-Ftp, a nice tool to push your changes via FTP to your web-host when you don't have SSH or Git:

https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp

You can exclude your content-folder in the .gitignore file, so there are no conflicts when you add content on the web-version, but work on the templates and styles locally.
