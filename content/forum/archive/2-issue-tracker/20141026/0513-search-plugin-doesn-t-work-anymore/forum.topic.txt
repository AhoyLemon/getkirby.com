Text: Could it be that the search plugin described here (http://getkirby.com/blog/search) doesn't work anymore in v2?

Because I've set-up everything as described in the article, but I get the following error:

	Message
	Call to a member function pages() on a non-object
	File
	/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/sketchtips/v2/site/plugins/search.php
	Line
	91
	Code
	87    // do this to save the count function for all loops
	88    $countSearchwords = count($this->searchwords);
	89    
	90    // define the set of pages to search in
	91    $pages = ($this->in) ? $site->pages()->find($this->in)->children()->index() : $site->pages()->index();

I think an indicator that the search plugin doesn't work anymore in v2 is also that "thisURL()" also isn't available, as described here:

Any chance to get the search plugin fixed anytime soon?
