Text: I just tested this on my installation and couldn't reproduce that behaviour. Changing the title of home.txt did nothing but change the title in the text file, not the folder name. If you change the url of the file as well, this will then result in an error.

Do you use the latest release?

If you want to change the url, you can rename the folder, but then you will have to change the settings in config.php (`c::set('home', 'new_folder_name');` still seems to work, although that not documented in the options)
