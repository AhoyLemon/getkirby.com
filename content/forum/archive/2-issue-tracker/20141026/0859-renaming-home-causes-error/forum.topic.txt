Text: Context: I wanted my home page to be my about page as well. In the panel, I changed the page title to "about", hit save, and then the system rewrote the home folder to about, causing the exact same error found here:

Going into the folder and renaming "about" back to "home" fixed it, but this could be a concern for end users who rewrite their home page's title for H1 reasons.
