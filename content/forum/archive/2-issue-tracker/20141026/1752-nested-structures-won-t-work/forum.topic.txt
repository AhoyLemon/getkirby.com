Text: Hi all,

I am trying to build a Services page for a client, which needs nested structures.

The first structure works, but the second throws an error
    PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function fields() on a non-object in kirby/panel/app/controllers/views/editor.php on line 51

Below is my blueprint. 

    title: Services & Prices
        pages: false
        fields:
          title:
            label: Title
            type:  text
          structure:
            label: Prices
            type: structure
            fields:
              name:
                label: Name
                type: text
                required: true
              structure1:
                label: Prices
                type: structure
                fields:
                  name1:
                    label: Name
                    type: text
                    required: true
                  price:
                    label: Price
                    type: text
                    required: true


Is this a bug or isn't this possible to work?

Thanks in advance.

Roy.
