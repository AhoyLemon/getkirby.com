Text: Hi, I have the same problem, but without nesting a structure field nested in a structure field. 

here's my structure:

```
fields:
	...
	Preise:
		label: Preise
		type: structure 
		entry: >
			{{Label}}: {{Wert}}
		fields: 
			Label:
				label: label
				type: text 
			Wert:
				label: Wert
				type: text	
```

When I try to edit an entry or to add another one, I get the error

Fatal error: Call to a member function fields() on a non-object in /var/www/virtual/sbes/html/neu/panel/app/controllers/views/editor.php on line 51

Can anyone say, what is wrong here?
