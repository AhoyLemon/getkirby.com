Text: Pretty straigthforward. This blueprint doesn't work as is, because the Summary field is rendered as text (not textarea). Is this a "supposed-to-be-there" limitation?

It's actually a problem for another reason -- if I manually edit a file on the server, and then via the panel, the panel "flattens" the Summary field (stripping it from any line formatting).

Any idea what's wrong?

(Also, the labels for Summary and Tags appear as "summary" and "tags", uncapitalized, in the panel).

title: Blog (proper)
pages: true
files: true
fields:
  title:
    label: Title
    type:  text
  date:
    label: Date
    type: date
    format: YYYY/MM/DD
  summary:
  	label: Summary
    type:  textarea
  tags:
  	label: Tags
    type: text
  text:
    label: Text
    type:  textarea
pages:
  sort: flip

Cheers!

PS: Sorry about awkward formatting, I'm not sure how to format this correctly in Markdown.

EDIT: Okay, fixed. Just a matter of spaces and tabulations. If you have this problem: make sure the spaces are actual spaces, not tabs.
