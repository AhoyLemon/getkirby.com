Text: I was working on upgrading a current site to v2 and noticed that an old line no longer outputs what it used to.

I have an image (in a loop) that outputs a resized width with:

$image->fitHeight(500)->width()

The line no longer outputs anything.  Can't seem to get anything to come out of the fitHeight or fitWidth commands.

Hoping someone either has the same problem or I'm using it wrong.

Thanks!
