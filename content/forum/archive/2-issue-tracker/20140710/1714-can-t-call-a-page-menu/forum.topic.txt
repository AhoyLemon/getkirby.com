Text: Hello their !

I'm new at Kirby, but I was interested to create a website with it for a client (for a restaurant).
I'm trying to create a menu page which will list their sub-pages (invisible) as elements of the menu, so my client can add, edit and remove elements in the menu.
I was searching now for an hour why I can't edit my page in the panel. Is the blueprint wrong ? My page's template maybe ?
But I came to the conclusion thatâ€¦ you can't call a page "Menu" !
When you try to edit it in the panel, the URL is "localhost/panel/menu" and it's seems that Kirby is searching for something else, am I right ?
Can someone confirm me this bug ?

Thank you !
