Text: I created a field where the user could enter the filename of an image which should be featured.. I was then using $page->images()->get($page->fieldName()) to get the corresponding image - this was giving me php errors..

The reason was that $page->fieldName() is not a string.. but there isn't anything in the docs where you can get the string from the field... through some googling I discovered field->value() - this should be added to the docs.

As an added idea, why not check if the item passed to $files->get() is a field and then automatically convert it to a string?
