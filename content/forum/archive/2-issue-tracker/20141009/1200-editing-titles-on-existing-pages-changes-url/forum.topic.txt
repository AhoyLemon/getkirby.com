Text: In the panel, when editing an *existing* page's Title, it modifies that page's URL as well. 

This behavior is new to version 2.0 and I think it should be logged as a bug as it makes it very easy to break links within a website when a user just thinks they're changing some text (particularly since the URL that is being changed is hidden from view at the time)

BTW, loving the new 2.0, keep up the great work!

Thanks
