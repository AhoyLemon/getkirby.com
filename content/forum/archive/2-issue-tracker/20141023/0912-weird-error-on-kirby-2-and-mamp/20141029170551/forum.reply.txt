Text: Hey guys, 

this is the custom error handler which I built in Kirby 2 shortly before the release. Unfortunately it turned out to be not very helpful in many cases, especially when 

```php
c::set('debug', true);
```

is not switched on in the config. 

It has been removed in 2.0.1 and might return later in a more mature version. 
Please upgrade and check out the error messages shown by PHP. Add the rule above to your config if you don't get any output.
