Text: Hey,

I checked some off the last questions on errors mentioned in the forum but they don't match what I'm experiencing. I installed a new copy of Kirby 2 on my local MacBook Air. Created some templates, snippets and content. Everything basically works fine.

Sometimes nevertheless I get an error when loading the page or a subpage locally on my Mac (and using the lateste Mamp. Even though debug is turned on in the config, the errors I get are without comments?! Screenshot:

Error comments come up if I add some true errors to a template. But this screen sometimes shows up. The weird thing: Hitting refresh for 3-7 times brings back the page or subpage.

I sync the page (is in development) via bitbucket with another Mac (both running Yosemite and the latest Mamp and I'm experiencing the same issues there.

Anybody experiencing the same or got a clue on this one?
