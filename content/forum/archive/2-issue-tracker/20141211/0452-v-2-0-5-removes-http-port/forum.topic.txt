I've just downloaded v 2.0.5 even I didn't change anything, I just realise that Kirby removes the 8888 port.

all the resources seen like that;

 link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost/kirby-2.0.5/assets/css/main.css" 
instead of
 link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost:8888/kirby-2.0.5/assets/css/main.css" 

Is there a bug?
