Text: Is this still an issue with the latest updates?

Try pulling the develop branch of toolkit repo. There were some changes in there regarding ports/ssl/etc last month.

	cd kirby/toolkit
	git checkout develop
	git pull

You can read the bug discussion here if you like.. while it's not related to port :8888 directly, it may have an effect on it.

If the issue still exists, consider opening a bug on github for it or contacting bastian by e-mail. Those seem to get more attention than the forums.
