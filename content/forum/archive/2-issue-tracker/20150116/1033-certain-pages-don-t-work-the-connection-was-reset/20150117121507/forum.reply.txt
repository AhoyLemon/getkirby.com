Text: Well, I was using the default template and all of the text was inputted via the CMS so I can't see how it could have been anything I've done on my end. I think it's something to do with the contents of the page. Since this particular page had lots of code in it, once I wrapped it in ``` It seemed to be okay. 

If it crops up again (on a non-code page) I'll post on this thread.
