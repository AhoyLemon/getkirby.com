Text: I want to reopen this issue:
For me Kirby 2 doesn't behave like mentioned in Bastian's post: http://getkirby.com/forum/issue-tracker/20120529/kirbytext-with-images-p-tag-problem/#20130123105305

The problem is: If I put an image (which is rendered as a &lt;figure&gt;) inside a text paragraph it's also rendered there. However HTML doesn't allow to render block level elements (and &lt;figure&gt; is one) inside of &lt;p&gt; and so it is actually displayed outside the paragraph, also in the DOM if I inspect it, but not in the source code. So is there a way to omit the &lt;figure&gt;  tag and just get an &lt;img&gt; tag (without adding it manually)?
