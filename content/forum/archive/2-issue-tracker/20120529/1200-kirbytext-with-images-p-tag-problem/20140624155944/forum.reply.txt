Text: Thanks for sharing the jQuery solution. However what's the fallback on that if an user has JavaScript disabled? I'm using the latest Kirby build, and disabling line breaks does not fix this problem with images being wrapped in paragraphs whenever they're in-line or not.

What I'm trying to do is this. I have my paragraph tags determined to a max-width of say 640px and centred, but my layout design is for 960px. I would like to place images whenever I like inside that layout outside of paragraph tags for obvious reasons such as this (link: http://greloja.users39.interdns.co.uk/content-management/web-design-article/ text:example [this is my university assignment]).

I know Bastian is working on Kirby 2.0 currently, but I'm wondering if anyone has solved this particular problem using the current Kirby build (not 2.0). Apologises for necroing a thread but this one is the most promising one of them all when it comes to paragraph tags wrapping images and I feel that this one would be a better place for other people with the same problem.
