Text: Thanks for your contribution. The files:fales was just there twice on the screenshot but I have already taken care about it in the meantime after taking the screenshot.

I figured that it's something like two spaces indentation and played around a few more but it's not really consistent.

The blueprint code below works with all fields below now, i got a checkbox with text working too, however on the code below, with just two blanks ( proper identation like on all other fields ) it was giving errors or not showing the field.

When playing around with tabbing - especially after the first "info" field it got the whole thing to work, but weird thing being not consistently taking "2 spaces" without a problem.

If this helps: 

I am editing with notepad++
