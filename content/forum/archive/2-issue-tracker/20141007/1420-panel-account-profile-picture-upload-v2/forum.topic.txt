Text: I have been trying to upload a profile picture on my current user via panel and it has not done so. No error or whatsoever. After dragging a picture onto the upload box. It loads and after completetion there's no picture.

Uploading pictures / files everywhere else just works fine.

Pretty much newest apache on localhost.
