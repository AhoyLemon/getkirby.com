Text: Ironically, I'm encountering this same issue on OS X Yosemite with both Firefox and Safari, running Kirby 2 on NGINX. I've even changed my NGINX config to match what others have posted here saying it works. Granted, that has fixed a few route errors that I was encountering. However, I still can't get the avatar to upload. No error, no nothing. I get the progress bar but that's it. After it vanishes, I got nothing.
