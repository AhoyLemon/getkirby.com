Text: Hello I have upgraded from kirby 1 to kirby 2. Everything seems to work fine except my search page. I get the error message with the following error code:
**Fatal error: Cannot use object of type Obj as array in /app/kirby/toolkit/lib/a.php on line 414**

What would you suggest?
My search.php template file contains this code for the search function:
```
<?php

search = new search(array(
  'searchfield' => 'q',
  'words' => true,
  'in' => 'blog',
  'paginate'    => 10
));

$results = $search->results();

?>
```
