Text: I solved this by adding a ```page_id``` to the blueprint of each page:

```
fields:
  page_id:
    label: page ID
    type: text
    default: page_xyz
    help: "Careful when changing me"
```

Now, I can query a page without worrying about url changes, for example like so:
```
$pages->findBy('page_id', 'page_xyz');
```
And I could also name my snippets accordingly. Not ideal, but a bit better in case of multilingual sites and the potential of a client changing the url of a default language page and thus the uid.

In my opinion, as explained above, the ```uid``` of a page should not be changeable because some technical implementations may depend on it.
