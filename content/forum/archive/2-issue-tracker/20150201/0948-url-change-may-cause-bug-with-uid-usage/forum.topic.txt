Text: I think the uid should not be so easily linked to the url of a page.

Whenever a URL of a page is changed, the uid also changes. This may result in a potential problem, especially if something like the following is used as proposed in the [One-Pager solution](http://getkirby.com/docs/solutions/one-pager):

```
<?php
foreach($pages->visible() as $section) {
  snippet($section->uid(), array('data' => $section));
}
?>
```

**Scenario**: a client changes the url of a subpage (for whatever reason), and the loop breaks because the snippet name obviously does not change. But now, it's being referenced by the new uid.

**Possible fix**: The uid should not be so easily changeable via the panel or it should not be linked to the url. The ```url-key``` could be used to accomplish this, it already "works" for multilingual sites for non-default languages.
