Text: As far as I'm aware, you'd need to set an height, to prevent that image distortion.

Maybe a calculation of this height from it's original if it's absent, could be done and sat behind the scenes to prevent this distortion and allow for only setting a width, that would might be a feature request on the getkirby repository over at github.com if an issue haven't already been made for it :)
