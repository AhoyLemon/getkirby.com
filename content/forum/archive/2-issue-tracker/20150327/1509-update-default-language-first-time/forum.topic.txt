Text: i set up a site with one language, then i config multiple languages.
when i update content in the panel for the default language, it generates a new file page.de.txt, but do not remove the original file page.txt. For this reason i dont see the changes, still i delete the file page.txt by myself.

I think Kirby can do this automatically for the users.
