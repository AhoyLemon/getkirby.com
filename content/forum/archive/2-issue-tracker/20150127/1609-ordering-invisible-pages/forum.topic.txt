Text: The docs at http://getkirby.com/docs/content/adding-content#visible-and-invisible-pages state:

```
#Sorting pages
The prepended number for invisible pages also determines the order of those pages.
```

However, by definition, invisible pages aren't prepended with a number!
Am I misunderstanding the docs, or is there any other way of ordering hidden pages?
