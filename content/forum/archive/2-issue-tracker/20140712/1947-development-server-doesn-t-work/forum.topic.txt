Text: My Kirby install works fine on the production server. It is setup in the same folder on the dev server. It was working fine and then for some reason stopped. I have double checked to make sure all of the files on dev are the same as production. In fact, I deleted it all from the dev site and reuploaded everything.

It seems like it started when I installed the real Kirby license. 

I can't get it to output errors or anything. It outputs NOTHING. just a blank page, no html at all.

any thoughts?
