Text: Hello, I'm new to Kirby but maybe try outputting the paths of those folder to see where Kirby thinks they are?

Try throwing the following into a template:

```
<?php echo kirby()->roots()->controllers() ?>
<?php echo kirby()->roots()->content() ?>
```

I know that doesn't help solve the issue but maybe it could confirm what you're suspecting.
