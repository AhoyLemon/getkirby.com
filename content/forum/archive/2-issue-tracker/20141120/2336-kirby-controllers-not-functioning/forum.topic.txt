I'm trying to set up a simple tags/pagination system as shown (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/templates/controllers#the-controller text: here). 

I'm having issues with any variable I try being undefined, even if I copy that controller exactly. The only think that I can think of is that I'm using a custom folder structure. My index.php file is within the httpdocs folder.

/kirby
/site
/httpdocs/content

I have a template in ```/site/templates/journal.php``` and a controller in ```/site/controllers/journal.php```

Any ideas why the template isn't accessing the controller?
