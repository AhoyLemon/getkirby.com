Text: In Kirby 1, I had the entire site cached, and everything seemed to work well.

Now I'm running into a problem where if I have caching enabled (using the file method) the blog does weird things. If I manually go clear the cache the problem is resolved, but I'm trying to determine what is causing the problem.

What happens is that people go to joyent.com/blog and they get redirect to something like http://www.joyent.com/blog/filter:news/page:3.

Is this something related to the dynamic nature of the filters, where if somebody accesses a filter it might cache that and think it's the blog page? I'm not sure I understand the ins and outs of caching that much, but I never ran into a problem like this in Kirby 1.

If we figure out that this might actually be a bug, I'll submit a github issue, but wanted to hash it out first. Does anybody have any insight into this behavior?
