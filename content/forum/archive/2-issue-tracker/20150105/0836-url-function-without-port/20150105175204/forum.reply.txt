Text: You can take a look at this bug in the toolkit repo..

https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/issues/35

There's some fixes/changes to SSL/port issues in the develop branch. There are details on how to pull updates from develop branches  near the bottom of discussion.
	
	cd kirby/toolkit
	git checkout develop
	git pull

Not sure if this will resolve your issue or not but may be worth a try.
