Text: I've been working with the Dropbox integration and am trying to symlink the content. Whenever I create a symlink though, Kirby complains with the following.

```
Warning: scandir(/path/to/content): failed to open dir: Not a directory in /Users/craigmdennis/Sites/clients.simplebitdesign.com/kirby/core/page.php on line 278

Warning: scandir(): (errno 20): Not a directory in /path/to/kirby/core/page.php on line 278

Warning: array_diff(): Argument #1 is not an array in /path/to/kirby/core/page.php on line 278

Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /path/to/kirby/core/page.php on line 289

Fatal error: Call to a member function isErrorPage() on a non-object in /path/to/kirby/kirby.php on line 236
```

I've tried `ln -s`,  `ln -nfs` and creating an Alias directly through Finder on Mac.

Any suggestions?
