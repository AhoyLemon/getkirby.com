When I first accessed the panel and created my admin user, I put an underscore in the account name: admin_example

When I tried to log in with the account I created, I got the generic error telling me my username and/or password was wrong.

Apparently Kirby rewrote the underscore in the username to a dash. So it became admin-example. There was no dialog telling me what happened, so I was locked out of the panel until I figured out what happened.
