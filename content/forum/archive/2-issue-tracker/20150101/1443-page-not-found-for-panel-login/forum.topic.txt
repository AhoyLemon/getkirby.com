Text: Hi, I've just installed Kirby starterkit for the first time via a git clone, and am using NGINX. I'm using the conf file as show here:
http://getkirby.com/forum/general/20130218/nginx-server-config-for-kirby

This works for the main site, but I'm not able to access the panel at all. /panel redirects to /panel/login and then I get the "Error, page not found" text.

What am I doing wrong? I've tried to modify the conf file with an added location for /panel, and to write the request to /panel/index.php as the htaccess seems to suggest should work, but that still gives the same error
