Text: Hey @eric,

even though I replied via email and in the other topic I thought it'd be good to reply here as well. 

The bug is indeed breaking the search on PHP 5.3 which is not cool at all. I just pushed a fix for this to the develop branch on Github: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/tree/develop

It will be available in 2.0.3. Please feel free to post serious bugs on Github. I'm there more often to fix issues that get reported over there.

Cheers, Bastian
