Text: Well, I figured out what the issue is. My server was running on PHP 5.3 and MAMP was running version 5.5. After switching MAMP Pro to version 5.3.28 it gave me the exact same error as on my server. Going up to 5.4.30 or 5.5.14 on MAMP Pro made the error go away.

This means Kirby is NOT compatible with PHP version 5.3, but needs at least 5.4 to run correctly. I really wish that the devs would have stated that clearly in the requirements, would have saved me a lot of time. 

Please update your requirements (http://getkirby.com/docs/installation/download ) to reflect this!
