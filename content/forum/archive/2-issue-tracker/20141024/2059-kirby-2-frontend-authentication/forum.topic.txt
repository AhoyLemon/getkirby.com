Text: Hi all,

The Frontend Authentication plugin seems not to work in the Kirby2 environnement.

One problem is related to the way the path to 'accounts' folder is set in auth.php:

`$dir  = c::get('root.site') . '/accounts';`

c::get('root.site') gives nothing.

Auth::firewall() is also producing an error and, at this point, I have no idea why...

Any idea how to solve these ?
