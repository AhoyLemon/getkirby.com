Text: Hello everybody,

I activated Markdown Extra which comes shipped with Kirby so I can use Markdown within div-elements.

This works pretty well until the point where I need to create separate paragraphes of text, like so:

    <div class="my-class" markdown="1">
        This is the first paragraph
    
        This is the second paragraph
    </div>

Instead of rendering it like this:

    <div class="my-class">
        <p>This is the first paragraph</p>
    
        <p>This is the second paragraph</p>
    </div>

I get this result:

    <div class="my-class">
        <p>This is the first paragraph<br />
        This is the second paragraph</p>
    </div>

Is this wanted behavior I can control or is there something wrong with the parser?

Thanks for your help up front.
