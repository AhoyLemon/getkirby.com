Text: When I add a tag to a page via the Panel the page refreshes and does not save the tag.

Blueprint
  tags:
    label: Tags
    type: tags 

I can add a tag by editing the .txt file and once one tag is added though editing the text file it shows in the panel and I am able to add additional ones.

Thanks for any help.
