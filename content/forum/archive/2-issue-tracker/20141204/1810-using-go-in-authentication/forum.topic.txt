Text: Using the examples provided in [http://getkirby.com/docs/solutions/authentication](Authentication Solution) I am having a headers error that appears to step from the go($url="") code. I am running a multi language setup but otherwise the code for the login/router/protection is all from the sample.

am I doing something incorrect or is there a bug?
