Text: I have the same problem with Kirby2 Panel on a shared hosting platform.

All the files uploaded via FTP gets the 755 permission and thumbnail generation and editing or adding content from Panel doesn't work.

I tried different permissions for thumbs and content folders and found out that 747 permission solved the problem.

On the other hand when I create a new folder via FTP or the Panel, the new folder is still created with 755 permissions and panel gives me an error because it cannot create the .txt file in that folder.

So changing folder permissions turns out to be a temporary solution and it doesn't work when new content-as-folders are created with Panel.

I should also note that 755 permissions work great on another hosting provider. 

I think we need a more detailed description of what is causing this problem and how to solve it.
