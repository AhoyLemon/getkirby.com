Text: tinyurls don't seem to work – say i put <?php echo $page->tinyurl() ?> somewhere on my template and the browser then displays "http://mydomain.com/kirby-2.0.6/x/1rk29dx" (kirby is running within subfolder) – if i then navigate the browser to that tinyurl i get:

"Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/luckysta/public_html/kirby-2.0.6/site/tags/file.php:47) in /home/luckysta/public_html/kirby-2.0.6/kirby/toolkit/lib/header.php on line 195
