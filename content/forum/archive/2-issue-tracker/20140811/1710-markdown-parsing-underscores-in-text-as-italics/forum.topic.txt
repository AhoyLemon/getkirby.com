Text: Hi Guys,

Is there a way to either disable or change the markdown 'underscore at the start and end of text' for italics? It would seem that the markdown is removing underscores from our pages within kirby and adding italics which are not needed. For example:

In the pages content:
user_displayname : Mike Maye 
user_pwdpro : 2 
user_id : 6

Whats displayed to the user:
userdisplayname : Mike Maye 
userpwdpro : 2 
userid : 6

We're also using the highlight plugin to store source code, however due to the above issue any source code with underscores in it, looses those underscores when displayed to an end user.

Thanks,

Andy.
