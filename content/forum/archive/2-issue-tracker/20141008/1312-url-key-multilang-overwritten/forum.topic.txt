Text: I have followed this link http://getkirby.com/docs/languages/urls

And added the code in config.php

Everything works.

But I cannot get the custom url to work.

If I save the DE version it exceeds the EN version and vice verse...


If I add the URL-key for example the projects.de.txt it will be removed when updated trough the kirby panel.


Any thoughts?
