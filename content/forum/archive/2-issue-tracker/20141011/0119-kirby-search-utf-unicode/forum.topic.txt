Text: Hello,

I don't really believe that the origin for this problem lies with Kirby, but nevertheless it's worth mentioning.

Kirby (v2) search function wont match case insensitively if the string is Unicode. 

Ex:
Page contains string 'Månad' (month in Swedish).

A search for 'månad', 'Månad' or 'MåNAD' will return right results, but if the query is with a capital Å ('MÅNAD'), the search function will return empty.
