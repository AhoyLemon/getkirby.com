Text: Hello,

I think I might have found a bug with Safari and Frontend Authentication on Kirby.

To replicate simply create a few pages behind a firewall. Log in with username and password. The first page to load will work just fine, but whenever you try and move to another page behind the firewall it'll instead redirect back to the login page.

It seems the log in information is not persisting between pages for some reason (asking the browser to save the login information makes no difference).

A similar issue was described here: (link: http://getkirby.com/forum/issue-tracker/20140803/panel-login-not-working-on-safari text: Panel: Login not working on Safari) but this in relation to the kirby panel.

This is happening to Safari only, Chrome, Firefox and Opera work just fine. I'm using Safari 8.0 on Mac OS X and kirby 1.1.2

Anyone else stumbled on this problem? Thanks!
