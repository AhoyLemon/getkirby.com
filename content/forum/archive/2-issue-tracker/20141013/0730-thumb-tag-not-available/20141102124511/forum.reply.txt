Text: @bastianallgeier Hi Bastian. I had this same issue (I think). 

I think Tobias means `$page->images()->first()->thumb()->url()` which used to be available in Kirby 1. But no longer works in Kirby 2. 

You could specify an image alongside a content page like `example.thumb.jpg` and this tag would fetch the thumbnail image.

Will this come back or will filterBy be the method to use instead?
