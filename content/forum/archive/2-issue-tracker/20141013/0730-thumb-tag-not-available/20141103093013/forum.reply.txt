Text: Hello !

In v1 it is possible to use (thumb: image.jpg)  to include a thumbnail of an  image directly in content files, like {(}image: image.jpg{)}. That is what i meant with thumb tag.

To use it you need the plugin thumb. php and a kirbytext extension with enhances kirbytext with the thumb function. But why do i have to explain this to you , you wrote this ? ! ;)

Thats a very handy feature and it should be included in v2.
