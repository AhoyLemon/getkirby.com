Text: After upgrading to Kirby 2.0.3, creating users is failing silently. The initial user creation is handled well and works flawlessly. However, when I attempt to add another user it simply redirects to the users view with only the original user present.

Any thoughts on how I could debug this?

**Update**
It appears that this bug was introduced in 2.0.3. I downgraded to 2.0.2 and it is working fine.
