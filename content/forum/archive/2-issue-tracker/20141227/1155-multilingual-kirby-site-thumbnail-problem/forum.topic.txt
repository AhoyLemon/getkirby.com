Text: I have bilingual Kirby installation which contains  English & Turkish (Default)

In localhost everything is working fine but on the server thumb function generates an error in default language. But second language is working fine.

The error is;
Fatal error: Class 'abeautifulsiteSimpleImage' not found in /vhosts/disturbedpeople.com/http/cks-2.0.1/kirby/toolkit/lib/thumb.php on line 290


Turkish (default) version;

English verion (working fine)
