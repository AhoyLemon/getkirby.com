Text: Hi guys,

I just want to let you know, that I'm always looking for new awesome Kirby projects to work on.

I have worked with Kirby (version 1 & 2) a lot and built several website projects using it. I also created quite a list of custom plugins and themes for my previous clients.

My latest (open-source) project is (link: http://getkirby-plugins.com text: getkirby-plugins.com). It's a (of course Kirby based) list of all available Kirby plugins and extensions. Since all of the code is open source, feel free to visit its (link: https://github.com/JonasDoebertin/getkirby-plugins text: Github repository) and have a look at my code quality.
