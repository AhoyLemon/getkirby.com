Text: For those getting the preg_match_all() error. Update your server to at least PHP version 5.4.30 . My server was running on 5.3, which should have been able to run Kirby according to the requirements. However, after testing with version 5.3 on MAMP I got the same error as on my server. 

This means Kirby is NOT compatible with PHP 5.3!
