Text: Sorry, but the snippet of @kurvenschubser doesn't quite work. I'm really a noob in PHP, but was able to fix it like this:

	$query = isset($_GET['q']) ? $_GET['q'] : null; // or use param('...')
	if ($query) {
		$results = $site->search($query);

	    if ($results != "") {
	        foreach ($results as $result) {
	            echo $result->title().", ".$result->excerpt().", ...";  
	        }
	    } else {
	    	echo "Nothing found!";
	    }
	}

1. Replaced "for" with "foreach" since that's the way to loop through an array
2. In case nothing is found the text "Nothing found!" is echoed.

## Please fix!
Also, you should remove this article (http://getkirby.com/blog/search) from the blog, because the plugin doesn't work anymore. Me and others discovered that it throws an error (like described here: http://getkirby.com/forum/issue-tracker/20141026/search-plugin-doesn-t-work-anymore).
