Text: Hey guys, 

sorry for being so quiet here. There are currently too many incoming requests via email and I have a hard time showing up here as well. I hope I can fix this soon. 

The bug is indeed breaking the search on PHP 5.3 which is not cool at all. I just pushed a fix for this to the develop branch on Github: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/tree/develop 

It will be available in 2.0.3. Please feel free to post serious bugs on Github. I'm there more often to fix issues that get reported over there. 

Cheers, Bastian
