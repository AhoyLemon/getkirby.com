Text: Uh-oh. I had the old search plugin working just fine, but now it throws an error (even with the updated code from @devcharly). It throws "Call to a member function pages() on a non-object" referencing line 91, which has this:

```
$pages = ($this->in) ? $site->pages()->find($this->in)->children()->index() : $site->pages()->index();
```

Anybody else getting this error, or know how to get past it?
