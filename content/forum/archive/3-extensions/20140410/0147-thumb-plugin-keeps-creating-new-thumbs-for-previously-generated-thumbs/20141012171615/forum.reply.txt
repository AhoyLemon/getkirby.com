Text: I fix it by removing hashname on kirby\kirby\kirby.php line 75.

      'thumbs.filename'        => '{safeName}-{hash}.{extension}',

into

      'thumbs.filename'        => '{safeName}.{extension}',

Unless bastian create new thumbnail system ( I vote thumbs subfolder inside content folder) it will work as long you don't have file with same name.
