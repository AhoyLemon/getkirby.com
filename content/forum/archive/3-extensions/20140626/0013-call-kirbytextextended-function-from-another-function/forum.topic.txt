Text: I may be doing something n00b-ish, but this is my first time extending Kirby; 

I've got a function to spit out images that uses the picturefill.js to interpret srcset and sizes on an image tag - that works OK using (picture:image.jpg).

However, I have a second function (picture_grid:image1.jpg,image2.jpg) that needs to call the first - when I do so, php moans that the function is undefined. It definitely isn't.

Does Kirby wall off those functions so they can't be called from one another? Have I missed something vital?
