Text: @thisislawatts Hey, this looks great!

I've installed and tried out the plugin but I'm having some issues:
<http://cl.ly/image/46053p3W3w1A>

My PHP knowledge is very limited and I've just tried adding the images as I would with the thumbnail plugin.

```php
<?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
  <?php echo picture($image); ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

The images have been generated into the pictures folder and the image src seems correct but the images aren't working.

Is there something I'm missing?

Any help would be appreciated.
