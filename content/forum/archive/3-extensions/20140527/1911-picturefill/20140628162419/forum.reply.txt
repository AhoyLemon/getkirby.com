Text: Hi!

Thanks for this. Just tried it out, but unfortunately got some error message about allocated memory for pictures.php.

Just wondering if there isn't any other way to do this without having that extra folder and letting it generate new files?

Using the code from Picturefill in a template and getting the images from a folder/page. 
Then looping if there are multiple images (each images has 3 different versions/dimensions), finally creating a <code>figure</code> for each image.

Is that possible with Kirby?

Edit: seems like this doesn't support HTML-tags. Pleas see the see the Gist: <https://gist.github.com/khalidl/42ad554ca6241c99274e>
