Text: Easy enough to do using kirby v2 new router and a bit of javascript.

`file.pdf`
`file.pdf.txt` => `count: 0`

and in your page:

```
Link to my file here: "( file: file.pdf class: js-dl-count  )"
```

In a javascript  file run on your page you would hook on the click event of links with the js-dl-count class and make a POST request on your custom route which would update +1 the "count" field in the file's meta

```
$('.js-dl-count').click(function(e){
// Code to handle POST request to url
});
```

I am not going to spoon feed you but this is the basic idea.

Good luck ;)
