Text: This is a extened version of the officale image KirbyText tag.

*Version:* 0.7

## Features
* same feature like the original version
* figure block is only active when a caption will added
* define if caption is at the top or bottom
* Support of thumb
    * crop
    * resize
    * blur
    * grayscale
    * upscale (not working at the moment)
* The complete logic is in a static method, so you can used it every where in Kirby (example: template)
* Many Kirby-Config-Parameters (at the moment I use the Kirby namespace for the config parameters)
* Simple image gallery function
