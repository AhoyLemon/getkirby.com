Text: I just had to sign up to tell you guys thank you for the contact form!

Perhaps you should submit it as a plugin?

Edit: Actually, on second thought, I noticed that  I'm not actually getting any emails when I submit the form... does anyone have any ideas on how I can find out what's going wrong?

Could it be that you use $email as a variable, when that's a built-in Kirby Helper? http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/helpers/email

Second edit: my bad, turns out it just takes a (long) while.
