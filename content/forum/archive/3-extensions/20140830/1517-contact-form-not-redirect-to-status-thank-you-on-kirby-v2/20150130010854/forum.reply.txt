Text: Any of you have trouble when putting the submitter's e-mail address directly in the "from" field in the e-mail header (as shown in a couple examples above)? I was using the contact form plugin (v2) and was finding email not getting delivered reliably -- especially if the person submitting the form had a gmail address.

My understanding is that the "from" field should have the hosting domain, not the sender's domain. The submitter's address should go in a "replyTo" field. Thoughts?
