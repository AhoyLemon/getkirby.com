Text: The readme for the Contact Form plugin is kinda vague in that it says "set your email address and other options" but doesn't actually give an example or suggest how one do that. After a bit of research, I came up with this, which seems to be working. But just curious: Is this best practice? Is it secure?

    $form = new contactform(array(
      'to'       => 'Joe <joe@example.com>',
      'from'     => get('email'),
      'subject'  => get('name') . ' sent a message from your contact form on ' . date('M j, Y'),
      'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:thank-you',
      'required' => array('name', 'email', 'text'),
      'keep'     => array('name', 'email', 'text')
    ));
