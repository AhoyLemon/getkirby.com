It's been in Alpha for around two years, and I've been struggling to make it submit my form via postmark, but so far no luck. I followed the setup instructions, set my postmark API in configuration, but all I get on submit is:
'The email could not be sent. Please try again later.'

I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it, so hopefully someone has already had similar experience and could offer some solutions, or some pointers.

Thanks
