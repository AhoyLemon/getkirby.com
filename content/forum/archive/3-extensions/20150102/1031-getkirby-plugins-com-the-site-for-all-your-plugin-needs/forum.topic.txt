Text: Hi guys,

I just want to introduce you to (link: http://getkirby-plugins.com) real quick.

It's basically a list of plugins and extensions for Kirby 2. The plan is to make it the definitive resources for all your plugin needs, so you don't have to search through GitHub and Google to find a specific plugin.

If you know about a plugin or extension you'd like to add to the site, or if you even created it yourself, please let me know. Either as an answer to this topic or via the (link: http://goo.gl/forms/bZNxXPHsC8 text: plugin submission form).

Let me know what you think about the site! I'm happy to improve based on your feedback.

Cheers, Jonas
