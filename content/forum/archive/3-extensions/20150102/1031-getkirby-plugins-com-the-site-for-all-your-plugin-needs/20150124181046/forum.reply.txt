### I have two small suggestions:

1. Perhaps make the whole plugin's container (tile) a link to the documentation rather than just the 2 links at the below the descriptions.
2. Add a third link below the description to the forum post that announces the plugin. I personal enjoy reading the discussion surrounding the plugin. 

Thanks again for this resource!
