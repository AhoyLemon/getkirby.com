Text: Kirby 2 features a nice email function which i use to send out several emails. It's quite easy to build your own contact form with it.

To do it the easy way, you could just add the code several times over with diffrent varables. Might not be the most thoughtful way though, but works. 

Adding a foreach previously in front of this code?

```
$email = email(array(
  'to'      => 'bastian@getkirby.com',
  'from'    => 'my@email.com',
  'subject' => 'Sending emails with Kirby is easy',
  'body'    => 'Hey! This was really easy!'
));

if($email->send()) {
  echo 'The email has been sent';
} else {
  echo $email->error();
}

```
