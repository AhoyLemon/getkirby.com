Text: I had to modify the contactform.php plugin file too, and it seems to work: 

the submit function (from line 30):  

    $recipientslist = $self->options('recipientslist');
    $recipient = $self->value('recipient'); 
    $to = $recipientslist[$recipient]; 
    $self->options('to', $to);

If someone has a solution to avoid modifying this plugin fileâ€¦
