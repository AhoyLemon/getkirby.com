Text: Hey there, 
im really new to Kirby and wanna try a few things out and see if i can make a small cool site with it in the future.

Anyway im having some trouble with installing my first plugin. I don´t  know how to adding the calendar object as it is described at  https://github.com/mzur/kirby-calendar-plugin/#calendar-object

I guess i can add the snippet as it´s described via the panel on a new blank site, right?

Thanks in advance!
