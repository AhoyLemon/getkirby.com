since the old fancybox extension that @lukasbestle built for me back in the  old v1 days broke in the v2 transition, I took the chance to replace the rather bloated fancybox with a Featherlight.js lightbox (and also since I figured fixing fancybox was just as much work).

Installing and using it is super easy.
Make sure you include jQuery and the Featherlight CSS in your header using:
    <?php echo js("http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"); ?>
    <?php echo css("http://cdn.rawgit.com/noelboss/featherlight/master/release/featherlight.min.css"); ?>

add a /site/tags/lightbox.php file with this content:
		<?php
		kirbytext::$tags['lightbox'] = array (
		'attr' => array (
		  'group', 'display', 'badge'
		),
		'html' => function($tag) {
			$name = $tag->attr('lightbox');
			$image = ($tag->page()->url()).'/'.$name;
			$group = $tag->attr('group', "default");
			$display = $tag->attr('display', "inline");
			$badge = $tag->attr('badge', "");
			  return '<a href="' . $image . '" data-featherlight="image" style="display: ' . $display . '; position: relative;" rel="' . $group . '" title="' . $name . '"><img src="' . $image . '" alt="' . $name . '" />' . $badge . '</a>';
		  }
		);
		?>

Finally add this line right before the </body> tag:
    <?php	echo js("http://cdn.rawgit.com/noelboss/featherlight/master/release/featherlight.min.js") ; ?>

Done.

Now you can embed a lightbox by using (lightbox: filename.jpg).
You can add "group", "display" and "badge" attributes if you want, but it's not necessary.
