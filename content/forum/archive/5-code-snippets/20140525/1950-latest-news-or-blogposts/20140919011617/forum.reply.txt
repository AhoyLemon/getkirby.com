Text: Thanks for posting the above code snippet.  I've included it into my template for my 'home' page to bring back the latest 5 blog entries, but it only brings back latest $blog->children posts, not children of children, etc.  My blog is 4 levels deep and uses the 'treemenu' snippet for navigation.  How would I change code to include latest 5 posts from all sub levels?

My structure looks like this:
- about us
- blog
-- projects
--- project 1
--- project 2
--- project 3
-- hobbies
--- hobbies 1
--- hobbies 2
-- music
--- band 1
--- band 2
