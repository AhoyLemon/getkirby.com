Text: I am an SEO Manager and have started to use Kirby for page load speed improvements as it is database free and very customisable. I am SEO crazy I thought I would share my htaccess file that will assist your website to load faster, more secure and also better for the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).

I have also included several (thousands) of spam related IP's (these can be found starting on line: 322). The .htaccess file will block them for you. You will receive less spam as they will not be able to see your website. WOOHOO !!! More time to code.  

**** PLEASE NOTE **** 

change line 8,9,11 to include your domain. Replace: domain.com with your website domain name.

Replace your existing .htaccess file with the following. It includes the standard kirby htaccess rules.

I would love to see what others are doing to improve your sites performance and security ! Please feel free to add any ideas and comments to this post.
