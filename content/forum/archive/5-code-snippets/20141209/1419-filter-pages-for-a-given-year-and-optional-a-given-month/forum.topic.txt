Text: Hey there,

I couldn't find any build-in function for doing this, therefore I did it on my own.
Put the code in your controller and append /year:2014 or /year:2014/month:12 to your links.

If there **is** any build-in function like this, I would be happy to hear about it :)

**Todo**: Make routes for URLs like /2014/12

```
<?php

return function($site, $pages, $page) {

  $children = $page->children();

  if($year = param('year')) {
    $childrenYear = new Pages;
    foreach ($children as $c) {
      if($c->date('Y') == $year) $childrenYear->add($c);
    }
    $children = $childrenYear;

    if($month = param('month')) {
      $childrenMonth = new Pages;
      foreach ($childrenMonth as $c) {
        if($c->date('m') == $month) $childrenMonth->add($c);
      }
      $children = $childrenMonth;
    }
  }

  return compact('children');

};

?>
```

Cheers, Jan

**Update:** new solution with custom Pages-objects. Now the Pages won't be iterated twice.
