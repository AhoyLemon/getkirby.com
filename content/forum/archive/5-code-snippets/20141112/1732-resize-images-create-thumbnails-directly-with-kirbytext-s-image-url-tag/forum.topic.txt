Text: What you wanna do is to overwrite the original tag with your version. So you go to ```/site/tags``` and create a new file ```image.php```. Insert the following code:
```
<?php
    kirbytext::$tags['image'] = array(
        'html' => function($tag) {
            $image = $tag->file($tag->attr('image'));
            return thumb($image,array('height' => 800));
        }
    );
?>
```
You can change the parameters of the (link:http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/helpers/thumb text:thumb()-method) to whatever you like.
If you got it right you should be able to get your tagged images automatically resized. 

This is a very basic example. Additional attributes the original ```image``` tag offers are not considered and the ```figure``` element is missing.
