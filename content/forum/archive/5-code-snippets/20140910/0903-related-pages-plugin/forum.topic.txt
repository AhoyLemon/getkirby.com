Text: Hi,

I'd like to share my "Related Pages" plugin for Kirby 1 and 2.

The plugin searches automatically for related pages on your site. A relationship is considered, when tags on the page which contains the plugin appears in other pages. The behavior is customizable.

Feel free to check out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Adspectus/Kirby-RelatedPages). Comments and enhancements are appreciated.

Cheers,
Uwe
