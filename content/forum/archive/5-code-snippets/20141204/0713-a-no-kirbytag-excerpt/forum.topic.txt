Text: Many of my pages contain a kirbytag for an image or lightbox (custom kirbytag) in the first paragraph.  Whenever I create an excerpt for such a page the text field from the image or lightbox tag becomes part of the excerpt. This makes the excerpt difficult to read for many pages. This custom method strips these (should catch all) kirbytags from the excerpt.
