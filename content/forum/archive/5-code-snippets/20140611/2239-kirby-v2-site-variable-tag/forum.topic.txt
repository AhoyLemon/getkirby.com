Text: I reworked something I used in 1.0 for 2.0. Maybe other people will find this useful, as I've seen other people looking for the feature in 1.0.

With this, you can use (site: author), (site: phone), or whatever else you may want to add values for to your Site blueprint.

It also wraps email in < > to properly convert it to a mailto url.

I haven't had any luck figuring out how to access the $pages or $page variable to get the current page though. If anyone has any thoughts on that, it'd solve some other things I'm working on converting. :)

	<?php
	// site variables
	kirbytext::$tags['site'] = array(
	  'attr' => array(
		'text'
	  ),
	  'html' => function($tag) {
		global $site;
		$variable = strtolower($tag->attr('site'));
		if($variable == 'email'):
			return '<'.$site->$variable().'>';
		else:
			return $site->$variable();
		endif;
