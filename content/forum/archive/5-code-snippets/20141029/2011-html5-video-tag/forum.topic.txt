Text: # What this tag does
I needed a way to display HTML5 videos in articles so I created a tag called "video" that renders the [old video snippet by Bastian](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/video) with some customizations. 

# The code
This is the snippet that goes to /site/snippets/video.php:
(gist:https://gist.github.com/jancbeck/a87c34e4df5b8764efb9 file:snippet.video.php)

This is the markdown tag that goes to /site/tags/video.php:
(gist:https://gist.github.com/jancbeck/a87c34e4df5b8764efb9 file:tag.video.php)

The markdown tag is basically a duplicate of the new image tag that was introduced in K2. This means the video is wrapped inside a `<figure>` element and supports captions.

# Example usage
Assuming you have a movie.mp4, movie.webm, movie.ogv and a movie-poster.jpg  file in your directory:
```
(video:movie.mp4 webm:movie.webm ogv:movie.ogv poster:movie-poster.jpg width:720 height:450 caption: Demonstrating the video tag)
```
The formats are optional and things should also work with external files, although that's not tested very well from my side. I needed a way to display local videos.
