Text: @yaccin  This is my current config file. As i have copied it from the Kirby parts [Bastians Gist](https://gist.github.com/bastianallgeier/c2e1f1e519f5f2943ec4)
Im not to bothered about cacheing anything, as the sites not in production yet.

```		
# php5-fpm content
				location ~ \.php$ {
				try_files $uri =404;
				fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
				fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
				fastcgi_index index.php;
				fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
				include fastcgi_params;
				}

		# block content
				location ~ ^/content/(.*).(txt|md|mdown)$ {
				rewrite ^/content/(.*).(txt|md|mdown)$ /error redirect;
				}

		# block all files in the site folder from being accessed directly
				location ~ ^/site/(.*)$ {
				rewrite ^/site/(.*)$ /error redirect;
				}

		# block all files in the kirby folder
				location ~ ^/kirby/(.*)$ {
				rewrite ^/kirby/(.*)$ /error redirect;
				}

		# site links
				location / {
				try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$uri&$args;
				}

		# panel links
				location /panel {
				try_files $uri $uri/ /panel/index.php?$uri&$args;
				}

		# deny access to .htaccess files
				location ~ /\.ht {
				deny all;
				}
```
