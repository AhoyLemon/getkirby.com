Text: Hello folks,

on my project-pages http://domain/portfolio_1/project_1/ I’d like to have a link, which points to the parent directory, so in this case http://domain/portfolio_1/ — though that’s needs to be dynamic, because I’m having one project-snippet for several projects.

I tried <code>echo $page->parent()</code> but that’s the wrong approach, it gives me the correct name of the directory (so portfolio_1), but adds it to http://domain/portfolio_1/, so I’m getting an error.

Any ideas on this?

Thanks for your help!
