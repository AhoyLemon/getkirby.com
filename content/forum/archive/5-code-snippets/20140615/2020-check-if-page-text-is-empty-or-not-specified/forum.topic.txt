Text: Hey everyone!

I'm looking for something like:

    if kirbytext ($page->text()) not empty; then
    <?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>
    else
    do nothing
    endif

With "not empty" I mean:

1.) There is no "Text:" in my page-file, or
2.) There's nothing after "Text: ", nothing but a trailing whitespace – that's what the panel does if you don't enter any text

Thanks in advance!
