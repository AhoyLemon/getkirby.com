Text: In my experience, `$page->somefield()` was falsy if not in the source content or empty in Kirby 1 and in Kirby 2b2. So you could do:

    if ($page->somefield()) {
      // We have a value for this field, do something
    }

In Kirby 2.0.0 it seems to be returning different values, so that it’s not reliable to test if `$page->somefield()` is “true” or “false”.

I emailed Bastian and he recommended using this instead:

    if ($page->somefield()->empty()) {
      // We don't have a value for this field, or the value was blank
    }
    // or:
    if (!$page->somefield()->empty()) {
      // We do have a value for this field
    }

Hope this helps.
