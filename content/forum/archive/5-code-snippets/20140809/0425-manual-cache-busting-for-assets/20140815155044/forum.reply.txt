Text: Were you adding the variable to the url part of the helper or after the helper tag?

js('script.js' . $site->version())


I believe I tried that recently and I thought it was working (in 2.0 at least).

The problem I ran into was I want to use an absolute url pointing to cloudfront, without declaring http:// or https:// .. and it automatically adds a "/" to it, even when using "//...com" because it deems it relative.


What would be really nice is if the config had something similar to the "url" setting for "assetUrl" or "cdnUrl".. that would automatically add the url to all relative assets, without also overwriting the url in the browser bar.
