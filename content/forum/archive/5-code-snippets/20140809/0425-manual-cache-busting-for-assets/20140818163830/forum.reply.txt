Text: I ended up hacking Kirby so that all image embeds in kirbytext, as well as ones generated in php with `->url()` as well as all Kirby-generated js and css embeds add a query string with the modification date of the file.

The one downside I've seen so far is that you can only use it with local files, so I should really add a check to the file to see if the files are local before implementing. If it were official, I'd add in a config option. Maybe I'll look into implementing it with Kirby 2 beta, and then submit it as a request to Bastian.
