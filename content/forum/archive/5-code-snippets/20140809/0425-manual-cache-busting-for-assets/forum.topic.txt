Just thought to share a technique I've been using to control cache busting on certain assets.

Just Add some fields with the asset description in your site.txt:

`

    Css: 1.29

    ----

    Plugins: 1.2

    ----

    Main: 0.52
`
Now just add those site variables to an asset link or helper:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $site->url() ?>/assets/css/main.css?v=<?php echo $site->css() ?>">`

With a helper:
`<?php echo css('assets/css/main.css'.'?v='.$site->css()) ?>`

The final output should be:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="SITE_ROOT/assets/css/main.css?v=1.29">`

This way, every time you update your CSS, JS or any other asset you'll just need to update the site.txt var to a greater number to force a re-download.
