Text: Hi!

I think there is a big drawback in rendering, because too much opening and closing P tags were inserted. Markdown doesn't like content beetween DIV tags. So this solution relies on wrapping the markup for rows and cols in P tags by the kirbytext function. Is there a better solution? Can the rendering process be turned around (first Markdown, then Kirbytags)?
