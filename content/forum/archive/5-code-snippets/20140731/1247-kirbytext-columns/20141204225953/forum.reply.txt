We adapted this to the new custom tag world. Everything seems to be set up correctly, but content in between two tags is not rendered as html but plain text. So all the markdown syntax appears in the output.

Here an example:

```
kirbytext::$tags['twocol'] = array(
  'html' => function($tag) {
    $options = $tag->attr('twocol');
    // this works: return "<div></div>" 
    if($options == 'start') {
        return '<div class="row"><div class="six columns">';
    } elseif($options == 'break') {
        return '</div><div class="six columns">';
    } elseif($options == 'end') {
        return '</div></div>';
    }
  }
);
```

```
## h2 works
(twocol:  start) 
### Appears not as a h3, but as "###"
(twocol: break)
# Same here, no html output generated
(twocol: end)
```

If the return value is overriden with for example ```<div></div>```, the content in between is rendered fine. So i guess it's because of the unclosed divs?

Anybody an idea what we're missing? 

Cheers
