Text: I'm not sure I understand your issue. You said you wanted to separate the videos into their own video tag, making each video their own video..

If you want them all to be the source for a single video, you can use Bastian's HTML5 video snippet.

If you want to loop through each video file, and have each one get displayed, the loop I posted above should work.

What exactly is the end goal you're trying to achieve?
