I'm about to leave for a long-awaited trip with my family. This means that I won't be able to provide full email support during the next week. Please post your questions in the forum in the meantime: <http://forum.getkirby.com> 

But of course I don't want to leave you with empty hands and provide a little compensation for the reduced support. 

**(link: buy text: Kirby Pro licenses) will be 20% off for the next four days.
Take the chance and get your pro license (link: buy text: now!)** 

See you in a week! 
Cheers, Bastian

P.S. if you can't wait, you can check out a first little developer preview of some of Kirby 2.2's new features: 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit.git
cd starterkit
git checkout develop
git submodule update
cd ../panel
git checkout feature/Decruft
```

I leave you with that. Be aware that it is still work in progress. Don't use it for anything in production. Things will break! 

More details will follow the week after next week :)
